- 1.4.0 (2025-10-25):
  - Added two-card combos! You can now browse two-card combos, synergies, rushes, counters and nombos on their own sub-page.
  - Added filter to require both CSOs for interactions/combos to be from the same expansion.

  - Added better description about how the total qualities of a kingdom are calculated on the about page.
  - Overhauled kingdom display and some details for the randomizer
    + I now use segmented control instead of tabs, which should decrease loading times as e.g. the kingdom plot is only generated when needed.
    + Removed kingdom plot and reroll view from kingdom card display and moved them to their own tabs.
    + Made reroll buttons show up below pictures by default.
    + Added capability to display Shelters or Colony/Plat.
    + Added capability to display additional components (e.g., Coffers) needed to play a kingdom to aid physical play.
    + Added capability to display special rules interactions, and even two-card-combos that might appear in the kingdom.
    + The kingdom csv string is now displayed in an expander in the sidebar for easy access.
    + Fixed an annoying major bug where upon first visiting the randomizer, the expansions would be deselected upon pressing 'randomize kingdom', essentially throwing an error.
  - Overhauled the UI up top for the kingdom oracle to make selecting existing kingdoms more accessible.
    + Added capability to copy the kingdom csv string to clipboard on the sidebar.
    + Added capability to filter for combos, interactions, and playthroughs.

  - Overhauled/improved the interactions site
    + Added more interactions and updated for Duration errata.
    + Changed description to be showed in expander up top to make intent and purposes more clear.
    + Reordered columns for interaction display (users may still move them manually, but I think moving CSO images to the right is the correct call).
    + Added neat little filter indicators
  - Cluttered the page with more icons. Might be a bit much now, but I think it helps with navigation.
