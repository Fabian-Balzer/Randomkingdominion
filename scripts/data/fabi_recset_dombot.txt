The Emperor's Merchant---artist, transmute, chapel, merchant, riverboat(litter), alchemist, rustic_village, throne_room, laboratory, rice, kind_emperor, gather

Stay Healthy---encampment, riverboat(stables), change, royal_galley, rustic_village, silk_merchant, charm, journeyman, tea_house, sack_of_loot, sickness, amass---Interesting set concerning Sickness; taking Curses is really punishing, so you end up discarding a lot, which makes it even more important to set up the next turns properly.

Going Fishing---daimyo, fishmonger, pawn, aristocrat, cutpurse, ironmonger, figurine, first_mate, scepter, peddler, way_of_the_otter, toil---Can you spot the hidden central interaction that allows for some consistency on this no-trashing board?---15-3 in 10 turns against Hard AI

Triumphant Bureaucracy---university, experiment, gardens, ninja, river_shrine, rustic_village, crown, litter, vampire, animal_fair, bureaucracy, triumph---This one is a doozie and can go either way - if you and your opponent decide to go for the River Shrine route, you might end up with a weird Gardens rush with Triumph intermixed. Otherwise be sure to be that person that pops the Bureaucracy to get those juicy Triumphs in.---185-15 in 17 turns as second player against Hard AI
Multi-Route Business---daimyo, patrician, riverboat(souk), exorcist, ferryman(amulet), kitsune, rice_broker, tea_house, altar, prince, good_harvest, museum---Daimyo is super strong as always, but which Actions should you pair with it to get a good Harvest in?---54-30 in 12 turns as first player against Hard AI
Capitalist Dreams---raze, village, hostelry, ironworks, patron, archive, galleria, magnate, mastermind, animal_fair, capitalism, cathedral---Incredible Capitalism synergies. You even get to discard Patrons for Coffers if you do it right---33-0 in 12 turns as first player against Hard AI
