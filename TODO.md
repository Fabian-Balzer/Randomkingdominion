# TODOS

Things and ideas I am having to improve 

## General

### Backend and implementation stuff

- Refactor Data_Container with get and set methods
- Refactor how the randomizer picks cards depending on the attributes given
- Implement 'Revert to recommended settings'

- Implement kingdom history
- Show kingdom strength from general availability of engine components
- Write Tests

### Randomizer options

- Add options to prioritize an expansion or to choose a subset of expansions
- Add options to distribute the cost
- Add options to take other card metadata into account
- Add options to disable attacks or require reaction
- Implement picking Trait, Obelisk, Mouse and Bane Cards

### UI

- Add sorting options for kingdom (and fix sorting of debt/potion cost cards)
- Implement showing the whole kingdom to set up (e.g. Wishes, Boons, Loot)
- Implement Shortened Kingdom View (i.e. only name, picture and cost)
- Implement showing the number of cards in a setup pile

### Card metadata

- Fix debt cost
- Add TrashType (All, Treasure, NoTreasure, Action)?
