The interactions below are meant to cover finicky pairwise rules interactions between Card-Shaped Objects (CSOs) that might not be immediately obvious.

The interactions have been gathered under the assumption that those reading them have a base knowledge of the rules of Dominion and are looking for edge-cases and things that might not be 100 % intuitive.

### What kind of interactions can you *not* find here?

While there are ton of different combinations (actually, considering that by now there exist $\\sim{N_CSOS}$ CSOs, there'd be {_get_pairwise_comb_str(N_CSOS)} possible pairwise combinations), the ones showcased here do **not** cover straight-forward interactions like Village/Smithy.

More specifically, the following general interactions are omitted here:

- **Basic strategy**:\\\nCommon synergies to e.g. build engines, e.g. typical Village-Smithy-like interactions.
- **Two-CSO combos**:\\\nAny powerful two-CSO combos like Lurker/Hunting Grounds, Collection/Stampede, Beggar/Guildhall, etc.. These are omitted here as this tool's intent is to cover shady rules interactions and not strategies. You can however find those at the [CSO combos](/combos) subpage of this website.
- **Shadows interacting with Ways**:\\\nSpeaking of shady; while Shadow cards can be played as Ways even from your deck, I decided to omit specifying for each Shadow card that they can be played as a given Way from your deck.

### Contribution

The project was initiated by `nave` on the [Dominion Discord](https://discord.gg/dominiongame).

If you have any suggestions for interactions that are not covered here but you think would fit in, feel free to visit the `#rules-lookup-project` channel on the discord.
