For the purpose of this page, the following types of pairwise interactions (sometimes overlapping with the [rules interactions](/interactions)) are defined and roughly ranked by strength (although counters don't really fit in here):

Rush > Combo > Synergy > Weak Synergy > Counter > Nombo

These are defined below, although arguably the distinctions tend to be a bit fuzzy at times. Note that I mostly do not include synergies that should be somewhat obvious, f.e. such as Battlefield/Mill or most Trail/VG/Weaver stuff (although I've decided to include a few notable ones).

- Rush: A strong and centralizing strategy that usually quickly ends the game if followed, and for which you mostly ignore everything else in the kingdom.
- Combo: Strong, centralizing synergies which usually will make you loose if you ignore them.
- Synergy: Stuff that very nicely works together but isn't always viable, such as Capitalism/Landing Party.
- Weak Synergy: Something that is pleasantly accelerating your build, but can also be skipped if stronger things are around, or stuff that might only be relevant at a specific point in the game (like Castles/Keep).\\\n**<span style="color:darkred">Note that these are filtered out in the dataframe below by default; you may view them by changing that in the 'other' filter tab.</span>**
- Counter: Some interaction of an Attack played by an opponent versus a card you might have wanted to use yourself, like Crown/Highwayman.
- Nombo: Something that actively anti-synergizes, or does not work as you might expect, like Trail/Improve.

### YouTube Links

#### Showcases

For some of the rushes and combos, I've added YouTube links that provide a dedicated explanation and showcase the combo in action. Especially [tracer](https://www.youtube.com/@tracerdominion) and [ceviri](https://www.youtube.com/@ceviridominion1636) have some great educational content on this!

#### Playthroughs

For synergies or combos for which I couldn't find dedicated showcase videos, I've added links to playthroughs by various content creators (usually TGG Dailies or League matches; heavily biased by my own viewing habits, including stuff by [JNails](https://www.youtube.com/@JacobNails1), [Sharur](https://www.youtube.com/@SharurFoF), [Mic Qsenoch](https://www.youtube.com/@MicQsenoch), [tracer](https://www.youtube.com/@tracerdominion), [RDon](https://www.youtube.com/@RDon40), and [myself](https://www.youtube.com/@fabyy5713)) where the interaction occurs.

Let me know if you find an interesting video that could be added here for things that don't have anything attached!
