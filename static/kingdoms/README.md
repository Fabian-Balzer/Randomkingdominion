This folder contains kingdoms existing somewhere.

## Recommended kingdoms

These are hand-curated sets by DXV himself, consisting of only one or two expansions.\
They are e.g. provided by Kieran Millar on his [Extra Recommended Sets](https://kieranmillar.github.io/extra-recommended-sets/) page, from which I have taken and formatted them for my needs. Check it out!

I am omitting the 1E kingdoms for simplicity.

## TGG Daily kingdoms

These kingdoms were randomly generated in order to provide a challenge against the Hard AI on the TGG dominion client.\
The randomization scheme ranges from picks from just one expansion to picks from all expansions on a weekly basis.\
On discord, the user ``probably-lost`` was kind enough to provide those to me up to mid-July 2024, from which point I started collecting them on my own. This would also not be possible without ``Igorbone`` and ``Diesel Pioneer``, who post the dombot string of the dailies each day.

## Other cool kingdoms

These are random kingdoms I've stumbled upon which seemed fun enough to save. Have fun playing them yourself, they are usually wild mixes of expansions.
