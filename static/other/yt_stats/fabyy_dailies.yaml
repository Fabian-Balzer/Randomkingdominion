    is a supercharged kingdom due to two of Dominion''s strongest events.


    The AI goes for a pretty fast money strategy, forcing up to take quite the risk
    on our last turn.

    We build a bit bigger with a bunch of Abundances, although I''m really not super
    sure about any of my acquisitions, there really are many viable options here at
    various points throughout the game.


    In the end the risk paid off; the win was not guaranteed off the Journey turn
    I took (although I''m not sure, since maybe with the remaining cards it was),
    but at least I''d have been able to get ahead in points a bunch, leaving little
    points for AI to acquire.


    Fun stuffs, I hope you enjoyed figuring this one out with me.

    We have the second-best opening here (in my opinion), managing to trash an early
    Estate into a Bridge. The following draws seem fine, but are far from optimal.
    On t5 this causes me to have a brain fart, sorry for babbling a little there lol.
    We struggle a bit to get out of Debt in the mid-game, but nonetheless get to trash
    down a lot, which is important for setting up a tight situation on t10:

    Can you find the win with me? Stop the game at 21:38!


    The AI had nothing really going on, mainly because it had a super junky deck in
    comparison to us.

    We would have been in a really comfortable position to pile out the next turn
    anyways, but it''s always great to be able to end the game as soon as possible.


    I also hope you don''t mind the somewhat extended introduction to the cards, I''m

  description: 'We face a really tricky kingdom with limited draw facilitated by Research.
    Our deck ends up coming together somewhat nicely, although AI''s buildup of Bridges
    and Processions (plus an Outpost mixed in) was quite scary.

    There''s a simple find-the-win at ~25:00 or 25:29 (wait a bit for me to show the
    trash) - still took me a bit to figure out, and I could have scored a bit more
    than I did - can you see how?


    Apologies for some longer pauses during the gameplay, this kingdom really had
    me thinking a lot, very intricate. Also apologies for no reflection of strategy
    in the end - I was still too flashed by finding that win. Overall I like most
    decisions there; getting a few extra Patron Villagers early was pleasant, I liked
    turning it into Outpost, and I liked having all of those Cobblers.

    If we didn''t have the win that turn, I think we would have just tried to set
    up for the next turn. But AI''s deck posed a real threat, and I''m not fully sure
    how I''d have maneuvered around that. Maybe one of the last Cobblers could have
    been a Ball (for Necromancers) already - my argument about them being draw-neutral
    doesn''t make a lot of sense, as you can draw the 4-cost card just as well. Also,
    good thing I blanked on the Research/Necro thingy!

    In any case - did you try to find the win in the position I was in?

  description: 'After yesterday''s Loot-heavy kingdom was super smooth for us, today''s
    one taunts us with horrible early-game luck, which AI manages to capitalize on.
    It keeps the pressure up with continous Ninja attacks while stocking up on good
    Rice payload.


    First, our River Shrine is paired up with Coppers and Silver only, followed by
    this critical t5-decision to play the Ninja, which we were immediately punished
    for by drawing the River Shrine dead (1 in 6 chance) - if that would''ve been
    a Copper, we should have been fine. Oh well. Also the River Shrine decided to
    miss the next shuffle as well, so it got to trashing any the correct stuff wayy
    too late.

    In addition to that we had that Sickness-shuffle where all three Villages where
    at the bottom of the shuffle, which didn''t help with our problems.


    We do manage to get somewhat clean towards the end, but the AI is too far ahead
    for us to catch up.


    The second playthrough (where our River Shrine manages to trash early Estates
    as it was supposed to) goes so much better.


    Still feels a bit sad to lose this one as I''m fairly confident we overall could
    beat the AI pretty consistently here; it does skip Artist, and in the second run
    didn''t even get up to Rice.

  description: 'This Base/Plunder kingdom is pretty Plunder-heavy, coming with three
    Loot-giving things and two Traits - we manage to steer through it nicely given
    our Mapmakers and a trusty early Sword. We confidently turn our Cellars into Sirens
    to have the AI stuck with 8 Curses while we retain deck control. Nice for a change!


    We find a surprisingly early opportunity to pile out, pretty neat. I hope you
    don''t mind the lengthy discussion in the beginning, was a bit all over the place
    but I did want to talk about the different Loots here.

  description: 'Campaign Sunday is usually quite fun - today feels a bit too RNG-heavy
    for my taste though. AI thrives on those moneyish kingdoms, and in especially
    in the first run we don''t seem to find any handle on the game.


    My opening suggestions might be garbage, skipping Monastery seemed fine in the
    third run.


    In the second playthrough, trashing the Gold to Farmland early was my biggest
    mistake I think. Being super thin with the Crypt didn''t feel that bad at first,
    but somehow AI outraced us and then had more Treasures in deck to survive the
    Duchy and Estate dancing.


    Well anyways I hope you enjoy to see me losing this one :D

    Also Seize should be buyable even after having Seized, I think that''s a bug (that''s
    probably in there for convenience to not accidentally waste a buy on it)

  description: 'I''m travelling, but I managed to squeeze in a quick playthrough of
    this peculiar kingdom with many strong synergies.

    We do make some of them work, although not everything works out as well as I pictured
    it - we struggled to properly get the draw going consistently, probably a Pilgrim
    might''ve been nice in there? Or better thinning? Also it would''ve been huge
    to see the Supplies t4, but oh well.


    It''s still enough to rack up loads of Coffers, which then enable us to quad Province,
    putting us out of reach of the AI.

  description: 'Interesting Adventures-heavy kingdom with limited thinning, heavily
    focused on interactions with Treasures - Magpies can draw them, Soothsayer can
    gain them, and Storytellers can turn them into draw. Trade allows to turn those
    nasty Curses into Silvers.


    Oh and I of course meant ''rectangular''-looking kingdom plot instead of ''square-ish''
    :D

    I also missed the Coin of the Realm-Storyteller interaction but realized it half-way
    through.


    We navigate this kingdom by stocking up on Storytellers, Magpies and Dungeons,
    which at one point allow for a nice Magpie autopile. With the Dungeons guaranteeing
    reliability and the Storytellers turning all of those Golds into big time draw,
    we are soon enough drawing deck almost every turn, and had the capability of double
    Province even followed by two times triple Province.


    The early draws were alright (although the Sooth missed the shuffle the second
    time around); the main difference here was AI completely skipping out on Storyteller.

  description: 'Yay, single set Nocturne! There''s a lot going on, we even start with
    three Heirlooms.


    We have a somewhat bumpy start, there is a brutal Poverty inhibiting us from popping
    our Lamp, but on the flip side, AI also only pops its Lamp pretty late. We manage
    to keep afloat by Exorcising a lot, having a Ghost sandwich for some reliability
    and draw, whereas AI''s only increase in handsize comes from some stray Pixie
    Wisps and its Crypts.


    It honestly didn''t feel like 19 turns, but apparently we had too many slowdowns
    and dud-like turns where we didn''t achieve much but slightly improve our deck
    in the midgame.

    There were also a few misplays probably, in hindsight I really dislike the second
    Crypt, I forgot to turn one into a Ghost later, and the second Exorcist is also
    not super impressive. But oh well, we''re back on track winning after yesterday''s
    desaster.

    I don''t think there was much to be done about those; maybe I should have embraced
    the junkyness a bit more, but the early draws (especially in the first one) were
    awful, which tips the scales a little too far in a junky kingdom like this one.
    Oh well.

    Campaign stuff - while the Pay-Latered Ropes were a nice addition and added some
    flexibility (and didn''t make the 3/4 open suck), what sped this kingdom up immensely
    was the Way Of The Owl-Necropolis stuff, paired with other cards that liked the
    Draw-to-X aspect such as Conclave, Artificer and Clerk.


    We had some subotimal draws early on, but we held on and built the better deck
    that utilized Arificer/Hound stuff, putting us in a position to triple-Province
    quite easily on our last turn.


    I also feel like I made some sequencing mistakes for the Clerk stuff, but oh well.

  description: 'What an expensive kingdom! To add to the fun, there''s also Tax to
    make everything even more expensive - even your turn 1 Cursed Gold.


    I get surprised by this (as you can see at 9:45), but decide to go for Butcher
    anyways (at least our opening allowed for this). We utilize this to cripple AI
    on turn 2.

    Nonetheless it takes super long until we get going, especially since our Butcher
    bottomdecks twice in a row.

    Once we do get going, we have our big turn on turn 17, depleting the Province
    pile as much as we can.

    The Loots we got were neither here nor there, although Insignia topdecking Province/Joust
    was pleasant.


    I have no clue what the correct path for this kingdom is; all of Butcher, HoP,
    Joust, Tragic Hero and somewhat also Wealthy Village are super strong cards, but
    they are just soooo expensive.

    I was pretty sure we were going to lose this one. We somehow pulled through when
    AI violated penultimate Province rule where it could''ve danced for a bit.


    The early draws didn''t work out all too greatly, AI seemed pretty far ahead off
    the Upgrade opening; maybe the difference was that it didn''t get a second one
    while we did, so we had a slight edge in the later game. A lot in this kingdom
    might also depend on how you manage to line up your Pirates.

  description: 'A Plunder kingdom that couldn''t be more Plunder-y - lots of Loot,
    lots of ''Next Time'', lots (6!) of kingdom Treasures, and Rush/Shaman to top
    it all off.


    We essentially both get to open standard double Shaman, as we both trash an Estate
    right away and get one back from each other (I was of course secretly hoping that
    AI would do us a favor and not have $4 on t1); but well, we could just so cope
    with that slow-down.


    We then commit a grave mistake in a moment where I seemingly forget how to add
    up $7+$7, so we miss out on early King''s Cache moments. A few turns later we
    finally manage to do what we aimed for, i.e. finally match up those King''s Caches
    with some Figurines, and kick off an insane sequence that ends up depleting 7
    piles.


    Fun stuffs, sorry for being a little tired towards the end.

  description: 'Ouch, this one hurts! It''s a super fast Replace kingdom that has
    complex interactions due to Encampment/Plunder and City stuff.

    We make the mistake of prematurely setting aside one of our Encampments on t10
    where we might''ve been able to wing it, and then another mistake of not trashing
    Gold to our Pooka (I briefly forgot that I could''ve revealed the remaining Plunder
    to Encampments as well). But there the draw for the last turn was far from optimal
    anyways, we also got a little unlucky I think. But the Undo attempt showed that
    we nevertheless could have won...


    Well, at least the replay attempt was even a turn faster.

  description: 'Another one for the books of crazy crazy campaign kingdoms! Essentially
    one starts with a clean slate of a deck due to Spoils replacing the Coppers. Therefore
    one can really cruise through everything, building up fast Souk economy to start
    triple-Provincing as early as turn 5.

    Maybe we should''ve delayed Provincing one turn longer, but it at least had AI
    stumped, having it go for Duchy/Duke.


    To test this out, we play another one right after in which we build a lot more,
    and it almost goes wrong as AI does play better, getting ahead by 4 Provinces;
    so while I think the second strategy is a bit more fun, the first one seems to
    be safer.

  description: 'We''re back with a super cute Shepherd engine supported by a gain
    train sponsored by Blockades and Cobblers.


    While AI does seem to have some right ideas in the early game concerning Blockades
    and Shepherds, its junky deck does not manage to hold up with us drawing deck
    each turn, gaining a multitude of shiny Victory cards.


    The Blockade bottomdeck on our part was a bit nasty though - at least we got to
    retaliate with two devastating Hexes for AI.


    Apologies for missing the past two days, life''s been stressful!

  description: 'Wheeeeee! That one was fun, a lot of gainy stuff going on with Artisan
    and Specialist paired with Family of Inventors.


    However also the AI kind of broke down, it thoroughly overtrashed and didn''t
    get any draw until it was too late.


    On the other hand, things were working out pretty smoothly for us. While trashing
    is certainly important here, you also need to get your draw up to support Artisan
    and Specialist properly. Then you should keep your eye on the Clashes pile (Warlords
    ahoi), waiting for an opportune moment to shut down the opponents monolithic deck.

  description: 'Campaign Sunday forces a very weird starting deck upon us, in a kingdom

    Decent shuffle luck is on our side, so we manage to get those in early enough
    to properly thin down the deck before exploding with Livery stuff. While I really
    enjoyed the endgame, the early game looks really swingy in my book.

  description: 'Full random can bring up very fun kingdoms, and this one does indeed
    have some potential. Although the early game is a little awkward in terms of gathering
    all the tools for your engine while also trying to advance a few Peasant lines,
    all this buildup does pay off.


    We never reeeally get to see the engine in action with the nice deck we built,
    but with Disciples, Paddocks and all of the Sanctuary +Buy (and maybe some Soldiers
    mixed in), you can potentially achieve really nice $$.

    Not a super fan of Graverobber here, but once you''ve got the deck clean it could
    also work out pretty well.

    Due to the imminent pile-out threat we however never go for all this fun stuff,
    ending the game just before with just a boring 3-points lead and our dear Teacher
    ending up on the wrong mat.


    After playing, I think it might be better to either delay the Order Of Masons
    discard (as Save does the same almost as nicely), or only discard one Estate,
    to be able to hit Sanctuary/Siren if possible. But I''m not super sure, the early
    game is pretty awkward here.

  description: 'Yuck, what a sad excuse of a kingdom - that''s what solo-Nocturne
    can do to ya.

    I''m super unsure as to how to play this one, so I resort to a formulaic strategy
    that proved to be nice in Geronimoo''s simulations (see https://github.com/Geronimoo/DominionSim).
    And the quick replay (which I also surely play a little too fast) confirms that
    this might''ve been the safer strategy.

    This junky, slow-trashing deck style that is continuously disrupted by Hexes and
    Raider is just super swingy to build, so it''s very possible the money deck gets
    the edge.

  description: 'In this one I thought we were done for after AI had the basically
    perfect opening (cursing us both t3 and t4) while we bottomdecked our Blockade.
    But somehow (I really don''t know how), we managed to prevail by consistently
    abusing the Blockade/Sailor synergy, running down the piles, and Blockading the
    Gardens in a crucial moment.


    I''m not even sure what the AI did worse except for the lack of Blockading; maybe
    it drew a few Actions dead with its Witches.


    Turn 8 I missed playing the Blockade to play another Sailor or Haven (to get the
    Action to play Witch), might''ve been the better play than just leaving the Blockade
    there.

  description: 'Having the chance to have the Platinum Sombrero? Count me in! On this
    campaign feature Sunday, we get to open triple Shaman (which fortunately don''t
    bottomdeck).


    This kingdom seems to stem from an Alchemy-focused campaign level, there are many
    strong Potion-cost cards. And what does the AI take away from that? It skips Potion
    and has a really terrible time. Arguably we also get ahead in trashing (mainly
    getting to trash Estates, while AI is forced to trash Coppers, possibly due to
    finding its Forager).

    For a Shaman kingdom, we get clean fairly quickly, also having some nice draws
    in the crucial mid-game (like finding Scrying Pool on top of our deck each turn).


    We don''t even need to come back from a huge victory point deficit, and we find
    a nice win via a Wild Hunt pileout. Also, I learnt that you can only ever discard
    one Friendly card per turn.


    Let me know what you think about the new audio settings!

  description: 'Another really fun one! While playing around Avoid proves to be a
    bit tricky, we have a very nice opening that allows us to push for a few Peasant
    lines brought up early.


    Whereas the AI is having itself stuck with a bunch of useless Encampments, we
    somehow reach Teacher and a few Disciples by t8 or so, get the Rabbling/Soldier
    economy online and get to wipe out the Supply t14.

    My only gripe is not buying more Potion the previous turn (which I couldn''t undo
    because of AI''s Search triggering).


    Nice!

  description: 'Well, this one has some really nice synergies, even though the Rich
    Throne Room is a bit of an eyesore :D


    We didn''t draw well in the early game (t2 Quartermaster would have been sooo
    nice); especially the repeated $4 hands afterwards weren''t great (although seeing
    our first QM at the top of the shuffle was good for sure), but our junking slows
    down the AI enough such that it doesn''t get the Quartermasters online all too
    quickly. Nonetheless we are put on a tight timer by their presence, so we really
    have to use everything our Library/Storeroom engine has in store for us.


    Really fun kingdom, was itching to play it again but had to leave. Oh well :D

  description: 'A kingdom without attacks, weak thinning and an expensive Village
    means that the engine might be tricky to build - but somehow we manage to prevail,

    That second Trading Post was pretty bad in hindsight, but the early-to-midgame
    shuffles (before you''re properly trashed down) are always subject to some shuffle
    variance I guess.


    Quick playthrough today as I was pretty tired.

  description: 'What an interesting kingdom! This one offers a strategy where you
    just continue to build up debt, never intending to pay it off.


    We have quite the nice start, getting super thin and dandy even before turn 7!
    Bureaucracy being here meant that you had to constantly keep your eye on trashing,
    and indeed we dud on turn 11 when most of our draw is in the lower half of the
    shuffle.

    But therefore at least we got to go out in style, driving our Debt up to 177 in
    the end :D


    I hope you didn''t mind yesterday''s April Fools :)

  description: 'We have a nice Alchemy/Base kingdom in which we manage to build slightly
    bigger and more focused than the AI.


    After a beautiful second shuffle, things slow down a tad when we decide to not
    play a Moat (which had a 2/9 chance of drawing key cards dead), and then a few
    Curses from AI''s Familiar get into our way.

    But AI never goes for both University and Library, which is a combo that allows
    us to reach our final score of 32 VP in just our last two turns.


    Fun one, felt fairly close (probably even like AI was ahead) at some points.

  description: 'Campaign stuff is supposed to be fun, not awful slog misery (well
    admittedly I do have a bunch of fun just laughing at the ridiculousness of this
    kingdom) - but a double-stamped Coven plus a doubled Curse pile is completely
    centralizing, drains two piles, and leads to some dice-roll late shuffles.


    At least we got it done with pretty nicely, winning the Curse split and such.
    AI''s War Chests and Band of Misfits were clear mistakes, really not sure why
    it went for those (and pretty frustrating that it was still so close lol).


    Pretty fast playthrough as well, the actual playthrough is just above 5 minutes,
    hopefully I didn''t play too quickly.


    Will hopefully have some better kingdoms next week xD

  description: 'Another Daily I get to record from my Hotel in Den Hague - this one
    allows us to build a super fun DIY-Apprentice deck with Shopkeeping Brokers.

    We get going fairly smoothly, and our deck feels superior to what AI is doing,
    but one late dud feels a bit scary nonetheless.


    Sorry for the dodgy video quality, I had a bunch of stuff running on my computer
    in parallel, maybe too much :)

  description: 'While travelling I do find the time to record this one, but maybe
    my sleep-deprivation is reflected in my quality of play - we''re losing the first
    attempt for the third time in the row (not counting yesterday, which I haven''t
    played yet).


    But that''s fine, at least it''s decently close. The engine is really hurt by
    greening here, and I somewhat failed to set up my Ghost sandwich.

    We then try out both a money strat and another iteration of the engine strat,
    where unfortunately the AI doesn''t really put up a challenge.

  description: 'Double Up is a Twist that double-gains each first Action or Treasure
    gained each of our turns, and enables for very interesting openings; this is enhanced
    by each player just starting with 5 Coffers, so you really get to choose to open
    whatever.


    In our first run, AI manages to attack us enough and run away in points such that
    we have no chance of catching up, even with +Buy. We also commit a few mistakes
    (most notably forgetting that putting the Silver gain off of a Blessed Village
    Boon to the start of our next turn would trigger Double Up), and all in all have
    too junky a deck in the end to really oppose AI.

    Even an endgame mistake of acquiring the third-to-last Province did not matter
    in the end, as we find out by Undoing to the point.


    In the second run, we however do get nicely clean and are able to build up a huge
    stack of Encampments. Fun!

  description: 'This kingdom does present some nice engine options, but Kitsune has
    to be prioritized first - as it turns out, playing it a bunch early can really
    really hurt.

    This exactly happens on our first try, AI gets to Curse us to neverland while
    our own, hard-earned t3 Kitsune is at the bottom of the next shuffle.

    Not sure what I could have done there, I guess sometimes it just comes down to
    luck in these games with Cursers.

    The second try is much smoother, we get to pay back AI with the same thing it
    did to us - while it is rolling around in the mud, our own deck is prospering.


    Not sure what else to say. At least the kingdom plot looked nice ^^

  description: 'We are greeted with a classical engine Kingdom on triple-set Friday,
    in which there''s Tax to slow us down, paired with no extra gains apart from Festival''s
    +Buy (okay, Forum and Catacombs gains, but they are finicky).


    Sorry for the suboptimal audio quality, I think I placed the microphone a bit
    too far from myself.


    We go for a nice City Quarter engine, which we get to set up by trashing down
    with Sentries, and get to ramp up via a few Golds from Windfall.

    AI mirrors this strategy, but trashes using Sacrifice instead of Sentry, and also
    slightly underbuilds.


    Unfortunately you''re a bit dependent on your draws after shuffling; We should
    certainly have put in a few Forums to try to set up stuff a bit better. This leads
    to one full dud and one almost-dud (the latter on the last turn) which we narrowly
    avoid by sacrificing an Emporium.

  description: 'A fun one again! Loads of intricate decisions revolving around Journey
    and Deliver, with the nice Cabin Boy/Shaman interaction on top.

    While we might have the worst of the opening splits, our 5/6 gamble on turn 2
    pays off as we are able to smuggle an Estate into AI''s reshuffle.

    From then on, we try to maximize gains from Cabin Boys, enabling to draw deck
    later once we''re independent of Journey.

    I''m not super convinced about my Grotto here, just didn''t feel great and we
    had the one unfortunate draw where it missed the Cabin Boy/Longship.


    AI did do some Cabin Boy/Shaman stuff as well, but did get buried in junk just
    a tad too much.

    Ever since it ended a long Daily streak against the AI a while back (when AI was
    a bit weaker) I''m pretty annoyed about it whenever it pops up.


    We opt for a simplistic strategy that can take advantage of Golds and Provinces
    being ''unswindlable''; however, we do have some annoying losses along the way.

    enough to close out the late game (ofc I was hoping for seeing Sailor t3, but
    oh well...).


    In this one I''m really unsure about what to open, many options seemed viable,
    but not great, and ultimately you''re much more influenced by the draws than by
    those choices.

  description: 'Wow! For the first time in recent (last 775) Daily history, we have
    a kingdom that has absolutely no means of gaining more than one card per turn
    (opponent''s Witches don''t count as you don''t have any influence whether they
    decide to buy them).

    I have therefore prepared some plots and also briefly showcase my Randomizer Website
    (https://randomkingdominion.streamlit.app), which allows you to not only randomize
    kingdoms, but also review/visualize kingdoms and browse the CSO database.


    The playthrough itself goes by quite smoothly - AI and I both have the 5/2, my
    Chapel and Witch unfortunately collide so we opt for skipping the t4 trash, possibly
    slowing us down a bit more than the Curse we put into AI''s deck (but also, we''d
    have just trashed 2C/1E and drawn 2E the next hand, so who knows).

    We then build towards quite a minimalistic deck with a few Pathfound Throne Rooms
    which provide excellent draw. The only thing I might have improved would''ve been
    a bit more reliability via Save, but oh well.

  description: 'On Campaign Sunday, everything seems possible. This time it''s a Durationified
    and Victorified Leprechaun, which makes it an even more fun card than it usually
    is.


    And even though I''m at first pretty sceptical about playing a Double Tactician
    Deck, we kind of get coerced into the setup by having the Wishes available for
    it. We keep up some nice attacks (even though we mess up Masq/Legionary multiple
    times) while having the Leprechaun-Duration sandwich going each turn, ending the
    game by double-Provincing twice.

    Super fun!

  description: 'This seems to be a week of slogs, let''s hope that doesn''t continue!
    With no trashing but abundant attacks, this one feels really weird. Luckily, we
    get the favorable 2/5 open, but unluckily, AI does as well, so the first few turns
    are just spent building up some Grotto draw while cycling back to the Tricksters
    a bunch.

    The game then turns fairly technical with lots of seemingly viable choices, and
    lots of potential drawing sadness. We however do manage to hit $10 for Invasion
    quite a bit, go for Vineyards, and just generally seem to get better through our
    deck than the AI.


    We also get to do some headache-inducing First Mate stuff. Fun!


    I don''t know why there are some robo-voice moments in this one, maybe I had too
    many programs running alongside the recording, sorry for that!

  description: 'What a slogfest! Even though I''m relieved AI doesn''t hit me with
    the Witch on a 5/2, the kingdom still is far from sparking any joy (except for
    the cathartic moment at which it is over).


    Well, buckle up for this time-wise short ride which felt like an eternity. The
    endgame felt quite intense on my end, maybe you''ll see my relief when it''s finally
    over and I realize I don''t have to play it again :D

  description: 'Crop Rotation, Bounty Hunter and Crop Rotation are already great money
    enablers, but what if all cards cost $1 less from the start of the game?

    You can see the result here, where the AI smokes us in the first attempt - main
    difference being our inability to hit either $6 or no-copper $5 early, while AI
    does so repeatedly. It was over by the time our Wealthy Village bottomdecked,
    disallowing the double Treasurer play to pick up GM.

    We try to just be fast enough to single Province before AI can score enough, but
    it just nopes us out of existence with a quick triple Province.

    Maybe that second Treasurer t3 should just have been an Alley.


    The second attempt goes more to our liking, but also in that one we hit $6 t3.
    Idk, felt pretty swingy to me, kind of dislike this one, although it''s ofc fun
    to see how fast you can go if your draws work out.

  description: 'This game is trash(ing a lot of cards as fast as possible). We get
    a bunch of Apprentices going slightly quicker than AI, but still get surprised
    by a pretty strong last turn on its side, where we on the other side almost completely
    dudded. Our lead in victory points is just enough to close the game out in a three-pile
    that we set up the turn before.


    Quite the interesting kingdom; due to the weird price points, it however is a
    bit on the finicky and snowbally side.

    Not sure how much AI''s two Bishop plays sped us up, certainly I wouldn''t recommend
    opening it her.

    Note that we still could have bought the last Curse even if we hadn''t drawn the
    Charlatan or if AI hadn''t played its own Charlatan. Still, the Rabbles plus the
    non-sight of Apprentices in our last hand was quite scary.

  description: 'This Allies/Menagerie kingdom is exploding with gains while being

    got us covered well, even though AI does come somewhat close to a pileout.

    In the end our deck is just capable of doing a lot more a lot more reliably as
    AI also forgot to thin, so we win with a nice pileout + double Province.

    In the end the Town Criers didn''t do much for us, but at least there was this

    We quickly go for a second playthrough which seems to be going much better, but
    a dumb decision of taking the penultimate Colony just because I wanted it to be
    over quickly ends our dream of just that - going back for the replay shows that
    we would indeed have won had we been more patient.


    In the third and final run we finally get thin as quickly as we had initially
    imagined even though our early Investment refuses to find Estates.

  description: 'Well well, I think there''s a big lesson to be learned from this one
    - before trying to go for a fancy win, really really make sure that you have all
    the gains and draw you''d need!


    In this one, we build a beautiful Market Square/Remodel/Throne Room/Lab deck with
    fairly decent draws in the early game and a two-Prov lead by t13, but then stupidly
    fall into the trap of thinking that we have a win (maybe there was one, but I''m
    too tired to go back and look); I think had we drawn a little differently there
    might have been something, but my attempt was not something you should ever do
    - dang!

    We luckily still manage to outscore the AI the coming turn, but it''s really really
    close and not really justified ^^


    Maybe I shouldn''t try this kinda stuff when tired/sicklish :D


    Also, if there was a win somewhere on this penultimate turn (or even one of the
    turns before) let me know!

  description: 'Campaign Sundays so far haven''t disappointed in speedy and crazy
    kingdoms. This one is no exception - we get a completely unjustified Head Start
    of 2 turns on the AI (for which it only gets a measly 10 VP in exchange).

    The setup basically guarantees (except for maybe two variations) being able to
    trash two Coppers + a Necro/OE before the AI has even started, and with the King''s
    Court/Souk combo being able to really quickly accumulate $$ that''s an insane
    advantage, especially if you can just get in the King''s Courts by Lurking. The
    final component is Farrier, which allows to set up a final explosive turn. Wow.

    In our playthrough we have quite a favourable opening (by which I mainly mean
    seeing Necro t2), and decent draws afterwards, enabling a finish on just t5. I
    wouldn''t be surprised if you can finish this one on ''four'' turns.

    Sorry for the rough morning voice!

  description: 'After a bunch of exciting kingdoms with much to do, we face a rather
    bland one with little to do - but at least there are a few interesting money things
    going on.

    We build a simplistic Tanuki/Masq deck with a high money density to then transition
    into a Colony endgame, which does get to be a little interesting due to us having
    to (and having the luxury to be able to) play around AI potentially going for
    double Colony. While we would have dudded on our last turn, AI releases us and
    just ends the game while being 9 VP behind.

    AI also went for a questionable Potion buy, not sure what that was about - even
    Conspirators would''ve been better.


    Sorry for my morning hair + voice - I recorded right after waking up after a party
    night :D

  description: 'What a kingdom! At first glance, this one looks just like your standard
    weak trashing engine board, but then you notice Bureaucracy and suddenly have
    to rethink your strategy - toning down on Universities and Grooms, and taking
    into account that Tanuki ''thinning'' always comes with penalty Coppers. This
    was so incredibly to me that I even prepared a meme!


    While we initially plan to just not trigger the Prophecy, AI has other plans and
    just opens with Poet, which we just follow to not miss out on the fun. At least
    we do hit $5 for an early Tanuki, and get the second one in not too much later.
    Due to Poet spam on both AI''s and our side, Bureaucracy already gets triggered
    on t7, prompting us to rush for the Provinces.

    Note that AI could have won had it hit $8 on its last turn, as I didn''t factor
    in the Estate gain from Groom. Since it does not, we are able to outscore it big
    time.

    Also pretty clear mistake on my penultimate turn - I should have Tanuki''d the
    Mastermind into Duchy to preserve the lead for sure!


    Hope you still enjoyed this even though I played a bit faster as I didn''t have
    much time (I''m happy I didn''t lose and have to replay this one).

  description: 'And here I was thinking yesterday was a nailbiter - in this one, we
    had various occasions of having to tiptoe around piles and almost got beaten by
    a weird Banquet-Charm-Den-Of-Sin-Raider strategy - who plays like that anyways?

    We however had one turn (t14 or so) where we could almost have won - it only went
    downhill afterwards. Watch me being somewhat speechless at the end when realizing
    we in fact did not lose this one.


    There are certainly a few tweaks where I could''ve played better (maybe just dumb
    Den Of Sin spam would''ve been better in the early game, only trying to set up
    Lamp stuff once those were gone), but also, with junky decks like this and the
    absence of trashing, anything can happen.

    It feels like we''re keeping our streak alive by pure willpower, getting closer
    and closer to a loss each game :D

  description: 'Yesterday and today feel like a cute Adventures showcase - while yesterday,
    the Page line was at least important, today the Peasant line is centralizing.
    At least as long as you''re going for the engine - Skulk and Quest plus a slow
    way toward the engine maybe justify just going for the money strategy.

    In our playthrough, we nonetheless decide to go for the engine; it all seems to
    go as planned as AI is only ahead by ~20 VP when we get our Teacher down and can
    start with the Ranger stuff, but then AI manages to Province once again and almost
    gets away with it, even though we continually attack it.

    Overall I liked how we played this, but yeah, this one was still the nailbiter.


    Also, watch my hair continuously getting weirder and wilder (just showered before
    the recording).

  description: 'Another tricky kingdom, this time on single-expansion Tuesday with
    Adventures stuff.

    The kingdom was mainly tricky due to the clear goal of trying to enforce some
    sort of Bridge Troll megaturn, while also trying to take care of both trashing,
    draw, and Page line advancements. My second Page line essentially got denied by
    AI constantly gaining three or more cards while my deck still was not as well
    trashed as I''d have liked it to be.

    Don''t know, really unsure about a bunch of those tiny choices with big impact
    - hope you don''t mind the slower approach on this one!


    I think on t6 maybe just buying Mission would have been better, trashing more
    Coppers and guaranteeing seeing the Page + Treasure Hunter. Hmm.

  description: 'Today''s one is a toughie which does not really go as planned in the
    first game (the Merchants should for sure have been Cellars or Hamlets), but we
    just so manage to win by 1 VP.

    To discover how a 4/3 open would play out, we replay the thing and get unrealistically
    good draws, slamming the AI in just 13 turns.

    Takeaway: In no-thinning kingdoms, make sure to have sifting or an overabundance
    of Labs if you can, and also connect Jousts and Provinces as early as possible.
    And be lucky enough for the AI to play suboptimally (as happened in our first

  description: 'Campaign Feature Sunday has delivered thus far, and does not disappoint
    today either - we get to start with a Potion in our starting decks, letting us
    hammer in Familiars and Curse the AI starting t2.

    We then play a weird Rats/Broker/Scrying Pool deck that quickly gains traction,
    although we take a bit longer than I''d have wished to put in Market Squares.

    I don''t play all too concentrated when trying to force the pileout, but eventually
    we get there.

  description: 'After an exceptionally fast kingdom yesterday, we face a villageless
    one today that turns into kind of a slog. Out of the diverse options of drawing,
    we decide to go for a Shepherd deck (in the end ending up with all 10 of them),
    while the AI goes for some Swamp Hag/Apprentice/Idol stuff.

    Due to the unreliable nature of early Shepherd stuff and AI''s Swamp Hags, it
    takes a long time to get going, and we never really get to pick up Idols to Curse
    the AI. We still get one, and it almost costs us the game as the Wind''s Gift
    we receive from it triggers a terrible shuffle with 9 green cards.

    Luckily we do topdeck a Shepherd as the 10th card (given the 8 Shepherds in our
    deck that at least wasn''t too unlikely), and from that point on get to do some
    nice shuffle management, consistently putting in Shepherds into the shuffles plus
    topdecking some using Way of the Frog.


    Hope you enjoyed this, especially the moment where I realized we''re hit by the
    Wind''s Hex :D

  description: 'Well, that was a wild ride in this wild kingdom.

    There are strong Daimyo synergies here, and if you know your Daimyo, you know
    it''s already busted without those.


    We open River Shrine/Daimyo only to see neither of them t3 and t4, but at least
    their collision gives us something.

    I then proceed to play a bit too fast, making an embarrassing Daimyo-buy mistake
    - but on t10, we are finally in a position to think about a possible win.

    Hope you enjoy this rollercoaster of a playthrough!

  description: 'It''s Adventures time, which comes with lots of viable strong choices
    both for opening and then throughout the game.

    AI keeps up the pace, forcing us to be careful around piles. We try a pileout
    ourselves but fail on t12, but at least set up the next turn in a way that allows
    us to finish then.


    We finally trace back whether we did have a win in the end, and yes, it''s great
    we did not go for the line I contemplated :D

    Had the Magpies found more Magpies, we might''ve been able to close it out t12
    already, but I''m fairly happy with how it worked out in the end as well.

  description: 'It''s Campaign Effect Sunday! And with that, we find another crazy
    kingdom, in which not one, not two, but three Stamps have been put onto the Clashes
    pile, making it ridiculously centralizing.

    We spend 13 minutes trying to wrap our head around all of the kingdom cards, and
    then engage in the grind - two well-timed Banishs get rid of most of our starting
    cards, and a somewhat slow-feeling buildup of payload pays off big time as we
    get to run circles around the AI.

    Loved it, hope I could bring across some of my excitement!

  description: 'Another 11-card kingdom! This time, Approaching Army is the culprit.
    With strong engine components but finicky thinning, we embark on a journey in
    which we almost never get to play our Riverboat due to collisions, and in which
    the mid-game draws don''t work out super well due to mistakes in Quartermaster
    stashing and due to the junky deck.

    Both AI and I get to put three Quartermasters into play (I think my third one
    should''ve been another Displace, probably). AI gets a points lead early, so the
    piles loom over our plays, but we can stall it just long enough for us to first
    catch up and then close it out on a turn where our deck finally comes together.

  description: 'In this one, we find an 11-card kingdom with two nice landscapes to
    dive into.

    Since the first playthrough felt a bit wonky (even though we managed to win),
    I decided to replay the kingdom, getting to a much more controlled deck faster
    by utilizing Sea Trade and early Hamlets in a much better way. Also we avoided
    any duds by continuously setting up the next turns via Farmhands, even though
    turns 5-8 didn''t play out perfectly (would''ve loved to find that Menagerie or
    another Hamlet t8).

    One of the most interesting things about this one is the question when and how
    to build up payload. Getting those Platina in felt correct, but also a bit slow
    - what AI did in the first game seemed to be a tad more efficient, I believe had
    it just built a turn more instead of the early double Colony, we wouldn''t have
    had any chances.


    Feel free to only watch one of them, I think they both might have some instructive
    thoughts hidden somewhere.

  description: 'After yesterday''s success in finding the win, see me blow it at a
    similar point this time - I think in this one there was no actual win and I should
    have just played it safe (gaining a few Stables, topping it off with an Inn to
    ensure a nice next shuffle). But instead I lowered piles like an idiot, thinking
    I might have had something. AI dudded in turn, allowing us to still secure the
    win, but oh my, I didn''t deserve that.


    In any case, Develop kingdoms consistently give me headaches, the double-gain-ability
    (especially paired with the Procession stuff here) is way too tricky for its own
    good.

    Hope you enjoyed the playthrough nonetheless!

  description: 'Again we find a strong engine kingdom, this time with fun Treasures
    to ramp up payload quickly. With the AI building just a tad bigger than us, it
    does get really close in the end but we''re just barely saved by our first player
    advantage. There were a few decisions that didn''t feel super smooth (like the
    First Mate into Siren, and the Puzzle Box Province set-aside), and the somewhat
    early Provincing, but the latter seems to have paid off as it forced the AI to
    stall, allowing the three-pile that we won with.

  description: 'We face a scarily fast Renaissance/Base kingdom in which our draws
    work out just well enough to breeze through. We never get to pick up the Sewers
    we aspired to get, but a slight edge on trashing with an additional Moneylender,
    as well as delaying the Vassal secure the win (also, undeniably, the first player
    advantage). The last turn still felt scarily close, maybe I took too many risks
    and should''ve just gone for a few Duchies.


    This one definitely feels like it could go either way; while we did not find a
    good time for Sewers, we did at least see the Remodel t3, and then found that
    Mountain Village later in the next shuffle to pair it with the new Swashy, which
    was a big boost. AI couldn''t quite follow, but I can see it punishing you for
    building slower, especially with Remodel + Treasure Chest around.


    Sorry if I sound a bit tired - that''s because I still am facing the lack of sleep
    due to yesterday''s skiing :)

  description: 'A tight money kingdom without any Village, but Power cards in Butcher
    and Wharf - we do get lucky with a 5/2 start and finish the game incredibly fast
    (just 12 turns with 33 VP).

    As a bonus, I showcase a possible outcome of a 3/4 open, but I''m much much less
    certain about my playstyle here. Also, RIP facing AI''s 5/2 with just a 3/4.

    There are a lot of nuances in these money kingdoms (I should have tracked AI''s
    deck better), but in the end a lot comes down to both opening, collision, and
    money distribution luck - we got fairly lucky in exactly hitting $8 a few times,
    although the Butcher Coffers also helped out.


    Dominion is a deck building card game created by Donald X. Vaccarino.

    Currently, there exist two online implementations: The browser and subscription-based
    Dominion Online (https://dominion.games/), and the multi-platform-, single-purchase-based

    as a free daily entry into a randomly generated (with some restrictions) kingdom,
    where you get to compete against their AI.

  description: 'Our trusty starting Coppers have been replaced by Spoils! The supercharged
    $15/$6 opening leads to some Highway/Wine Merchant/City Quarter madness, where
    soon nothing we do really matters anymore as AI manages to lock itself out of
    the game with a City Quarter buy and no $ in deck....


    We do have one unfortunate dud, and do play it rather safe, so this one should
    be possible a turn or two quicker.


    However, seeing the AI locked out like it is, we take advantage in an Undo attempt
    and see how many piles we can empty.

  description: 'Okay, this week it''s either no thinning or Chapel-level thinning,
    but then this kingdom comes with another big limitation - the absence of proper
    draw (until you get Joust Rewards).


    This makes the Clerk attack extra strong, maybe we should''ve even picked up a
    second one.

    AI goes for this and upsets our Chapel turn, but still we do get to reach two
    Provinces and pick up a few Rewards before it does.


    Not super convinced about the order of the Rewards, but Courser seemed like a
    nice reliability boost.

    one has some crazy multi-play capabilities, and Animal Fair makes for a strong
    target; if only everything would line up...


    And this time we''re on the not-so-lucky end of it, as AI manages to get its big
    Mastermind/Flagship/Animal Fair collision turn just before we do, snatching a
    victory.


    It was still weirdly fun, I gotta say - lining up those Masterminds and Flagships
    for that one incredible turn? If only you had a bit more agency.


    Had our Animal Fair not bottomdecked on t14 of the first game we might''ve eeked
    it out.

  description: 'In this one, AI has the most insane t3 high-roll imaginable... But
    then luckily it doesn''t follow through, Innovating an Outpost, essentially nullifying
    its own Monkey, and also completely forgetting to get any +Buy into its deck.


    This allows us to play the endgame somewhat precisely, dancing around AI''s limited
    capabilities.


    Its Outpost also helped out our Monkey draw, yanking us back into the game. Arguably
    we have some nice Piazza hits later on, so this really was a rollercoaster.


    Hope you enjoy the appetizer for my website coming soon!

    if you do not count the Victory Chips brought in by Collection and Bishop.

    Unfortunately, in this one the thinning is also almost non-existent, so a junky
    deck can certainly run into feels-bad situations.


    We are pretty lucky in that AI does open with Bishop, and then even has awful
    early draws (never connecting the Bishop to its Estates).


    Our early game and everything was working out insanely well (especially turn 8),
    until suddenly we had an awful shuffle afterwards, really only recovering on t12
    when we are behind in VP by a bit.


    Luckily enough, we run into a situation where apart from a correct AI-War Chest
    name, we might be able to win, and in the end we do pull it off.

    We do have a rather nice t3 trash, and from there on things are going quite smoothly
    (featuring a few headache-inducing gain-trains).

    Swap and Specialist together make for very interesting control over your deck,
    and AI did not put up much fight at all; but also, we managed to be rather fast.

  description: 'What a crazy crazy setup - We find Divine Wind for the first time
    in any Daily!

    In the TGG client, there is a cheaty way to reveal the DW kingdom in advance,
    which we abuse for the purpose of showcasing a nice playthrough - in a proper
    match this would feel a bit unfair, and I would certainly play the first kingdom
    differently (I think I''d have used the advantage we had to close it out and never
    go for Mountain Shrine).


    We get ahead in Encampments in the early game, stay in control for the rest, and
    even encounter a fun light-hearted find-the-win situation.

  description: 'This kingdom looks awful on the first glance, but against AI''s money-ish
    Provincing strategy, there is a cure in the form of gunning for Silvers and Feoda
    - this sloggy counterstrategy consistently was able to beat its deck in my testing,
    and is weirdly fun to execute.


    I didn''t expect to enjoy this one as much as I did, was fun in the end!


    Hope you like the extended discussion in the beginning, and also the arts collage
    discussion in the end :)

    me up! Unfortunately we cannot find it in our t1 hand, but nonetheless it supercharges
    a Stowaway-powered deck, which easily outpaces AI''s Provincing deck with a stark
    lack of draw.

    Fun one.

  description: 'This wild mix of expansions unfortunately doesn''t provide a wild
    kingdom - instead it''s a rather bland one where Gear/Money seems to be the best
    strategy, helped by Mining Road.


    I do not play this one particularly well, especially forgetting that I had a third
    Gear already...

    Nonetheless we start Provincing much earlier than AI, which is enough to close
    it out ahead.


    Shuffle management and tracking the deck well matters a lot here, and at least
    for the latter I didn''t seem to be concentrated enough today haha.

  description: 'It''s three-expansion Friday, coming at us with a Treasure-heavy kingdom,
    as one would expect from a Plunder- and Prosperity-laden set.


    Shaman slows down the early game quite a bit, but we are on the luckier side than
    the AI and manage to junk it before we get junked ourselves, allowing us to build
    quite recklessly and big.

    We never find the time for Pickaxe (which also would possibly supply your opponent
    with nice $3-cards were you to trash them), but keep stoically stacking our deck
    with Peddlers.


    Just when everything feels nice, our Peddlers and Magnates disconnect, and I misplay
    for a bit (I really ought to have used Puzzle box to set aside one Peddler on
    t14).


    Due to both Orb and Staff being at our disposal, we nonetheless manage to draw
    deck on the final turn, chaining a bunch of King''s Cache''s with Loot for a $121,
    26 Buy megaturn. Fun!

  description: 'What a lovely, finicky Monday kingdom! Both Draw and Village are scarce,
    with Scepter only allowing you to replay Actions in the buy phase. But fear not,
    the Thinning is strong, and the Gains are even stronger, so we try to go for it.


    We are greeted by the fabled Golden Sombrero, i.e., both our opening buys missing
    the first reshuffle - we could''ve prevented this by buying City Gate, but I still
    prefer the decision to go for Sewers.

    Despite this slow start, we get the very weird Inventor/Research/Scepter deck
    going, culminating in a turn on which we find all of the Scepters, allowing to
    get enough of a points lead to have Hard AI just concede.

    Fun stuff! Even Harbinger felt a bit more useful here than usual.

  description: 'We find another kingdom featuring Plunder - apparently it''s the most
    abundant expansion after the Base game (which is always featured on Mondays).

    The kingdom itself isn''t super exciting, the main thing is the limited draw in
    Stowaways - since we manage to secure the split 9-1, AI seems to completely break
    down, recklessly lowering piles with Fleet around after having overtrashed significantly.

  description: 'Another supercharged kingdom, even despite the limited trashing! There''s
    not even any time to trash out Old Witch''s Curses as the game is over before
    you see any of those hands - Inventor paired with Throne Room just evaporates
    piles.


    We have the 5/2 opening but opt for just opening Moneylender/Border Guard instead
    of sticking any of those juicy $5 costs into our deck, and it works out really
    nicely. Arguably we are a bit lucky to hit double $4 on the reshuffle, and get
    to consistently trash out Coppers, never really in need for Silos.


    There are a few interesting decision points at which I try to talk you through
    my thought process - having a good idea of what was left in my deck seemed pretty
    valuable here, but still I goof a bit with the ending.


    The 10 turns win was probably also sponsored by fairly decent draws and AI''s
    Council Room plays, but well, who am I to complain? :D

  description: 'Oh man, it happened again - I managed to not record my audio during
    the playthrough, so I decided to comment over myself playing once again. Super
    frustrating, but I hope you still enjoy the video - the kingdom itself had a lot
    good stuff to offer, tainted mainly by the presence of Berserker.

    Luckily the AI doesn''t go for one early on, while we grab two of them to keep
    the attacks up.

    I commit two grave mistakes (first not paying off Debt by playing a Silver before
    ending the Buy phase, then buying 5-Debt Berserker without any Actions in play),
    but somehow these still aren''t enough for AI to pull ahead. We get to gain a
    bit of control starting t9 onwards, and then only have to play it out while ahead,
    slowly ramping up payload and draw for a furious $66 last turn.


    For the openings, I forgot to mention the possibility of opening Berserker - That
    also doesn''t seem too bad, but you''ll forgo trashing to Temple early.


    Apologies for the commentary over myself, but I really didn''t want to replay
    this one as it was a bit of a drag (and could have been even more of one had AI
    gotten Berserker earlier).

  description: 'In this Seaside/Renaissance kingdom, there are once again two Projects
    framing the picture, with Fleet and Hideout supporting the naval theme.


    We do get to open the 5/2 with pretty nice opening draws, probably shutting the
    AI out of the game with the early Cursing (although I dislike its Salvager opening
    with Blockade around).


    The main takeaway of this might be to not skip Sewers, to stock up on Blockades,
    and also to maybe try to sneak in more draw?

    But oh well, a pileout presents itself after 12 turns, even without the Fleet
    turn being necessary.


    Sorry for only providing very brief pre-game discussion and a somewhat faster
    playthrough, but I was a bit pressed for time today.

  description: 'Seaside Tuesday without Sea Witch and Monkey can certainly be inspiring,
    and between all of those ships, we manage to navigate quite alright.


    The Blockade we open with unfortunately misses the shuffle, while AI has a sort
    of high roll by finding its Sailor and $5 on the same turn, but then it proceeds
    to stuff its deck with way too many Lighthouses that it can handle, such that
    our superior, well-oiled deck manages to overtake it in the naval hunt.


    Also, I would not recommend skipping Blockade here, especially with the Sailors
    they allow for incredible flexibility, particularly during the turns you don''t
    quite have your deck under control.


    Fun one!

  description: 'It''s Campaign Feature Sunday, this time greeting us with one of the
    most unpleasant Twists of the batch - Cramped!


    In the fashion of awful early hands, we manage to bottomdeck both of our opening
    buys, and then bottomdeck Spice Merchant and Exorcist a few times, taking a long
    time to get going.


    Once we do have our deck under enough control to draw it consistently, AI is also
    rolling! It plays this one pretty well, essentially following the same principles
    as we are (with slightly better draws I believe). The only difference is the absence
    of Exorcist in its deck. It does manage to triple and then double Province, putting
    us under serious pressure - I thought this was lost for sure, we were behind 6
    to 33 VP...


    However we don''t quite give up, banking on the Cramped hands coming to bite AI
    eventually...

    Even if the AI had pulled ahead further in points, we had our deck well under
    control to counteract most of its measures. Of course it helped to get ahead on
    the Magpies.


    The 4/3 opening with Maroon/City Gate felt quite nice, even though it took a bit
    until we hit $5, and we never ''needed'' the City Gate, it did allow us to shuffle
    our deck for turn 4 already, being somewhat supercharged.

    We have the rather mediocre 4/3 opening (5/2 is insane with Credit), but still
    manage to take off very nicely. The Ninja skip seems to pay off as we get to stuff
    a bunch of good cards (mainly Tanukis) into the deck.


    The Aristocrat buy (instead of Gather) is quite hilarious in hindsight, it''s
    comforting that we were able to beat AI pretty quickly nonetheless.

  description: 'Greetings from Texas! I managed to sneak in this recording before
    the observing run starts. Today, the kingdom offers loads and loads of decisions,
    with strong draw being absent.


    Yikes, sorry for the mouse being audible so loudly!


    We do fall behind a bit in the early game (especially due to AI''s many gains
    before we could play our Treasure Hunters), but later on gain control by having
    superior draw capability and flexibility with Swaps. Despite a late dud we finish
    with a nice double Province turn.

    After a messy early game where we are kind of slow on the trashing, we manage
    to stuff in a bunch of Minstrels, which propel our deck towards Invasions much
    faster than AI. Knights are skipped as Dame Josephine is on top.

    Fun and fast one!

  description: 'Back with this classical Village/Wharf engine with some University
    and Band of Misfits glue! We aren''t off to the greatest of starts, as after we
    find our Wharf at t3, draws don''t really work out in our favor and AI manages
    to secure the Wharf split before our Unis fully get online.


    This forces us to play around AI''s gain capabilities in the late game, and even
    though it duds and couldn''t even gain stuff to its fullest capabilities, I liked
    to be on the safe side there.


    In addition, I have a surprise analysis prepared at the end, enjoy :)

  description: 'Super fun stuffs with the campaign features. Our starting deck is
    all messed up with a mixture of junk and glitter (aka Ruins and Spoils), and Merchant
    Guild has that juicy With Horse stamp, enabling both draw and some nice fodder
    for our two Trash-For-Benefit things in the form of Expand and Exorcist.

    With Ghost being the only proper reliable Village (Dame Molly was nowhere to be
    seen here), Sir Vander was an amazing means of getting two cards costing more
    than $4 into the deck.


    While I really liked our approach, it''s arguable that AI didn''t really give
    this one a fair shot, as it completely devours its deck and is only capable of
    minor Province-Milling. But oh well, on our side it was fun.

  description: 'Pennies Saved is a campaign Twist notorious for crashing your game
    - and unfortunately it does so during this Daily playthrough as well.


    I set up an alternative within the Campaign kingdoms, sorry for the choppy video
    at the transition points (see this video if you want to learn how to do that:
    https://youtu.be/vW1aIFIniB4 ).


    The kingdom lends itself to a super simplistic strategy, with just a few Golds
    and an Outpost.


    Gameplay-wise, this might be the fastest playthrough, with only 2:50 minutes passing
    between start and end.

    Hope you enjoyed this, and I hope the Pennies Saved crash is fixed soon.

  description: 'What a complex kingdom. Saturdays certainly do have this in them sometimes.

    Also, my kingdom plot lies in that there is +buy in the form of Ruined Market
    here, which in the end allows for some nice double Provincing.


    Another takeaway here is to not do the Banquet thing the AI did, it''s really
    not great to clog your deck like this and led to us having a lot of agency without
    having to worry about whatever AI was doing.

    We go for a simplistic money strat but almost get outplayed by AI matching our
    speed with a super thin deck, while we miss our crucial price point of $8 a few
    times.

  description: 'What a doozie! AI plays those almost gainless (apart from +Buy and
    some Treasures from Treasurer) kingdoms quite well, and with Crop Rotation and
    Treasurer there are really good moneyish options here, disincentivizing going
    for a proper engine.

    I believe Priest econ could come together in time, but it''s going to be super
    close.

    In our playthrough, we went for the moneyish stuff that was mirrored by AI (although
    it did go for more Ducats+Archive and no Research) and are forced to enter a pretty
    complicated endgame, dancing the Duchy pile to the ground.

    We end up one gain short of a win on turn 11, but then mess up the buys causing

  description: 'It''s single expansion tuesday, and while Intrigue usually does not
    spark joy for these, here we manage to build quite the nice engine, outpacing
    AI in doing the same.


    The main difference was how we played our Lurkers; whereas we only picked up two
    (and a third one very late), AI went all out while leaving good stuff in the trash,
    and picking up rather useless cards (Patrol for this kingdom) from it.


    We also have quite the nice Wishing streak in the midgame, which leads to our
    commanding lead.

  description: 'In this Dark Ages/Base kingdom, we simply get outbuilt by an AI that
    builds a focused Smithy/Wandering Minstrel/Festival deck which is seemingly immune
    to our Sir Michael attacks.


    There are certainly some questionable decisions on my part, but I''m still not
    fully sure where we went wrong. Maybe the Library in the opening should''ve been
    Michael instead? Or a Festival, followed by more of what AI was doing?

    The main difference in our decks were the amount of Minstrels and Smithies in
    the end, which enabled AI to draw pretty reliably despite all the junk.


    In any case, these junky decks are not that much fun to play; therefore, in the
    rematch, when AI skips Dame Anna on top of the Knights pile, it''s a walk in the
    park for us to defeat it.


    This ends my streak of ~40 games without a loss, but it had to happen sometime,
    we had lots of very close calls in the recent past.

  description: 'AI traded two precious turns at the start of the game for 10 VP, which
    is quite the bad deal in this potent kingdom. Nonetheless the game quickly is
    on a pileout timer as there is the desirable Collection pile plus two cheap piles
    that are gone in no time.


    We opt to more or less skip Hermit/Madman stuff here but I can see it working
    out just as well; the Tireless Sentinel in combination with Villager-Fueled Maroon
    stuff allows for pretty quick clean up of the deck, stuffing it with Loot from
    Jewelled Eggs, leaving us to figure out good ways to draw. We achieve this with
    a bit of Alchemist and Artists, but it is arguably a bit finicky; The balance
    between grabbing enough of this stuff and enough Collections to be competitive
    is tight.

    Daily which displays a certain lack of ways to increase your handsize, but multiple

    We decide to play the Feodum-focused strategy and do get to outscore AI, although
    it was a tiny bit close at some point in the midgame when the Duchies were somewhat
    low; However, we had much superior scoring capabilities.

  description: 'Campaign Sunday thins the deck for us and replaces all starting Estates
    with Horses... Overall this kingdom had some crazy synergies going for it, and
    we almost manage to pile out on turn 7.

    The pileout attempt almost ends up being a warning example of flying too close
    to the sun, but luckily the AI cannot outscore us and empty piles at the same
    time, so we close it out on the next turn.


    Let me know in the comments whether I missed a guaranteed win at some point, I
    wouldn''t be too surprised.

  description: 'Yikes, what an ugly drawless kingdom. This one became super tactical
    towards the end, and I think I misplayed it slightly as the AI did have a slight
    edge in my opinion, overtaking us in a Duchy-dancing midgame.


    Nonetheless we find the very lucky last hand and Upgrade our trusty Amphora into
    the last Province for the win. Phew.


    AI having Jewels was kind of nice for tracking purposes, even though it didn''t
    matter too much in the end.

  description: 'Strong Menagerie stuff boosted by Pixie in the early game? I''m very
    happy to play that as long as I get to be player 1 :D


    We could''ve improved some buys in the midgame (looking at that Barge over Grove),
    but overall I like how we maneuvered this one.


    That last turn was excruciatingly long haha, AI really struggles with Horses.

  description: 'We''ve seen in the recent campaign playthrough that Rising Sun can
    be quite the powerful expansion, and indeed today''s kingdom shows this side,
    even without Daimyo (arguably the strongest Rising Sun card).


    We have a somewhat awkward early game, I kind of regret not having opened Alley/Mountain
    Shrine to be honest, as the Change/Mountain Shrine collision was pretty bad.

    Nonetheless we come out on top by moving out of AI''s reach with a nice last turn,
    which due to bottomdecking Artist however is not able to empty all Provinces.

    And indeed it does not take long for our Daily to crash because of it. I try to
    set up the kingdom in a custom way to be able to replay it, but, well... it keeps
    on crashing, and since it crashed pretty late in the game the last time, I decide
    to call it quits.

    Nonetheless I hope you enjoy watching my frustration about the crashes.

  description: 'So Much Stuff is a super game-warping Campaign Twist that rewards
    nice early game draws, quickly accelerating any deck that is working well. This
    effect is potentiated by Rewards being around, which can only be accessed by colliding
    Joust and Province.


    We lose the first attempt after bottomdecking Masquerade early on enabling AI
    to run away with the Rewards, combined with a crucial dud on our last turn - I
    think there was a possibility to still win if only we had drawn.


    The second attempt plays completely differently due to much better early game
    draws. Bit frustrating but oh well.

  description: 'No draw? No problem! At least if you can just hammer in Alleys to
    function as flexible Peddlers with Way of the Mule.

    Planning out what kind of deck we were aiming for really paid off here, leaving
    us with a clean way to score while keeping means to end the game via double-crowned
    Wine Merchants.


    Fun one!

  description: 'Three expansions yielding an 11-card kingdom with a perfectly balanced
    kingdom plot and no +Buy, but still lots of things to nicely do with Improve and
    Sculptors.

    The awkward limitation is that the Villages are buried below the Settlers, so
    it takes a bit to get going. But once we do, it''s super smooth, and we score
    a bunch of points just on the last turn.
