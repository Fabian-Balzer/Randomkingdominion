# Random KingDominion - yet another Dominion randomizer

A randomizer to generate and review Dominion kingdoms, exploring their capabilities to provide for engines.

## Features

- A randomizer with the following options:
  - Selecting Expansions
  - Banning and forcing CSOs into selection
  - Providing like/dislike weights for CSOs
  - Specifying required or excluded engine qualities desired for a kingdom
- A graphical user interface that can be started via python after cloning this repo

So far, only basic randomization with a bit of flexibility (i. e. setting draw, village and payload quality, and even attack types) is implemented, future work might involve selection of certain mechanics.

### Web Card Scraper

This comes with a .csv file of all current Dominion cards and the file 'card_scraper.py' which lets you scrape the Wiki for card information and images as soon as new cards are added. This uses the **Cards List** page.

### Installation

So far, this is basically a python file ('RandomKingdominion.py') that has to be run to open a GUI containing the randomizer.

### Affiliations

Dominion is a game by Donald X. Vaccarino and published by Rio Grande Games.
This project has no affiliation with either party. Card images were taken from the Dominion Strategy Wiki.
