## Random KingDominion - just another Dominion randomizer.
This application features a randomizer for a dominion kingdom which I wrote just as an exercise for myself.

So far, only basic randomization is being covered, but more flexibility (i. e. setting draw, village and payload quality or even attack types) is planned.

### Web Card Scraper
This comes with a .csv file of all current Dominion cards and the file 'card_scraper.py' which lets you scrape the Wiki for card information and images as soon as new cards are added.

### Installation
So far, this is basically a python file ('RandomKingdominion.py') that has to be run to open a GUI containing the randomizer.
In the future, I plan to convert this to a .exe file.

### Contribution
As I have not worked with GitHub collaborations so far, I am a little hesitant with that, but feel free to send pull requests and comment on my Code structure (I think it's awful... I'm still unsure how to best structure the data and the I/O coming from the GUI.)

### Affiliations
Dominion is by Donald X. Vaccarino and published by Rio Grande Games.
This project has no affiliation with either party. Card images are taken from the Dominion Strategy Wiki.
