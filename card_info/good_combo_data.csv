alms;villa;Almsing for Villas will allow you to play your Treasures later, allowing for an opening with $1 more, and staying relevant throughout the game.;Combo;;
amass;rebuild;Usually, the problem with Rebuild can be getting enough of them into your deck quickly - Amass lets you open double Rebuild, and allows you to easily pick up more if you miss them.

barbarian;overlord;With Barbarian, you can trash your opponent's Overlords into Curses, while also playing Overlords as Barbarians is possible, making for a weird game of luck (I'm not even sure what to classify this as).;Synergy;;
barbarian;scrying_pool;With Scrying Pool, you might be able to set up targets for Barbarian. On the other hand, getting your own Scrying Pool trashed is awful as you will gain a Curse for it.;Weak Synergy;Fabi: Daily playthrough;https://youtu.be/PF7Jx5RZIPk

biding_time;sheepdog;Reacting Sheepdogs in your Buy phase once Biding Time is active will draw you cards that you can set aside for your next turn.;Synergy;;
biding_time;shepherd;Very nice to set up lots of Shepherd draw. Might very well be worth not trashing any Estates, especially if Biding Time is likely to activate quickly.;Combo;;
biding_time;tactician;Since you discard your whole hand with Tactician, you won't be able to benefit from Biding Time on that turn, making Tactician decks less viable.;Nombo;;
