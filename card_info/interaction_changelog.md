#### captain - throne_room
If you play a Throne Room with a Captain, which plays a Duration card (such as another Captain), you will play the throned Captain twice this turn, but only once on the next turn. If the Captain-throned Duration card is one that might set aside cards (such as Gear or Royal Galley or Haven), the set-aside cards of the second play will become stuck in set-aside land (but still count towards your deck for scoring).
