*HAS BEEN CHANGED TO*
When you react and play Village Green during another player's turn, you can decide to play it as Way of the Chameleon. Remember that +$ can't normally be used on other player's turns.
If you play Village Green using Way of the Chameleon, remember that Way of the Chameleon only affects stuff happening *this turn*, so on your next turn, you will get the normal bonus from Village Green.
