# Quality assignments

Here, we'll briefly go through my thoughts behind the different qualities I have assigned to all Card-Shaped Objects (CSOs, these include Cards and Landscapes, and even things such as Artifacts and States, although I usually disregard those).

In short, I have devised them such that one can just add them up (see the very bottom for an explanation) for a given kingdom, to quickly be able to assert whether a certain quality is missing, or super strong.

I therefore needed to rank cards individually, and I limited myself to 3 different levels of strengths (4 if you count a non-existent one) for each card (or landscape) and quality, where 1 resembles a weak trait of the object, 2 corresponds to it being solid, and 3 is only awarded for the strongest and centralizing stuff.

In addition to the quality value itself, for all things except for *Interactivity* and *Alt-VP* I have also tried to provide what **Type** of the given quality a card provides - I have therefore come up with certain categories, which are somewhat arbitrary and certainly arguable, but I had to make decisions somewhere. They help to further discern a kingdom, e.g. you could see a kingdom with an excellent *Gain* quality, only to then notice that all the gain types are Workshop-like and there are no +Buys, or you could see that while there is *Draw* and *Village*, all *Draw* is Moat-like and all *Village* handsize-decreasing, so you're in for sad times.

The qualities I provide are the following (click on them to jump to the pages explaining them in detail):

- [Village](./village.md)
- [Draw](./draw.md)
- [Thinning](./thinning.md)
- [Extra Gains](./gain.md)
- [Attacks](./attack.md)
- [Alt-VP](./altvp.md)
- [Interactivity](./interactivity.md)

This selection should, after the qualities of all CSOs in a kingdom are combined, give an idea of how viable it is in a given kingdom to build an engine.
