Attacks are an integral part of the game, and continuous matter of debate and upset. Here I'm trying to summarize all the CSOs with the 'attack' type, and some more, as there are CSOs that do not explicitly have the 'Attack' type (like Masquerade, Embargo, Raid, or Possession), but definitely feel like attacks. These are assigned 'indirect' attack type (see below).

### Attack Quality

The three quality values are assigned based on an attack's (clearly subjective) suppressiveness.

### Attack Types

In addition to its strength, each of these attacks os labelled with its AttackType, where I define the following ones:

- **Deck order**: Attacks that dabble with the order of the opponent's deck (such as Rabble, but also Jester or Swindler)
- **Doom**: Since the hexes can be such a mixed bag, I assigned each Doom - Attack only the Doom type (which include basically all of the other types)
- **Handsize**: Militia, Raider and the likes.
- **Junking**: Looters, Cursers, Copper feeders.
- **Scoring**: Everything that might Curse.
- **Trashing**: Stuff that might trash cards from the opponent's deck. Cardinal is also in here, I guess.
- **Turn worsening**: Stuff that will make the opponent's turn worse and didn't really fit any of the other categories (mainly stuff giving out -Card and -Coin tokens).
- **Indirect**: These are mainly the ones that do not explicitly state the AttackType, but also stuff influencing your decisions like Blockade. Also: Monkey and Shaman as unconventional 'Attacks'.
