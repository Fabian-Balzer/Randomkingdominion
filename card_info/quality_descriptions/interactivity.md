I sometimes try to curate kingdoms that include interactive components apart from the dance around piles and the timing when to green in relation to your opponent.\
Of course all attacks are inherently interactive, but Dominion offers a lot of other player interactions like Artefacts, Gathering-Type cards or split piles. The ranking here is quite random and subjective.

### Interactivity Quality

The three quality values devised here had the following distinctions in mind:

1. Stuff that can barely be called interactive but is still better than most solitaire cards - here I included obvious once like trash interactions (Graverobber, Lich), Artifacts that aren't that relevant (Swashy), far-stretched stuff like Band of Misfits (depends on the piles you empty if opponents), Landmarks with VP tokens (where timing relative to opponents matters), and most split piles (relying on opponent to uncover stuff?).
2. Basically all attacks and random stuff that felt fairly interactive such as Advisor or Temple or Border Guard.
3. Stuff that really requires an opponent to make sense such as Flagbearer, Family of Inventors, Young Witch (Bane stuff matters), Monkey, but also strong Attacks that might alter the way you play like Clashes, or Shaman.

### Interactivity Types

Since this quality is already so subjective, I have refrained from trying to categorize the CSOs with any interactivity qualities.
