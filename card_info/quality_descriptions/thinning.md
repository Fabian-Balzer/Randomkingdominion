By thinning I consider effects that allow you to thin your deck.\
You might be surprised that I've also opted to include Remodel variants in here, even though they technically sometimes improve the quality of the cards in your deck (e.g. Enhance or even Mine).\
I am deliberately including exiling here.\
Other exotic thinning includes CSOs like Ambassador that allow you to return cards from your deck.

### Thinning Quality

The three quality values had the following distinctions in mind:

1. Weakish thinning stuff that tends to be somewhat niche (at thinning) such as most Remodel variants, Acolyte, Improve, Enlarge, or Governor.
2. All of the trashers and exilers that can thin one card at a time, and reliable but not necessarily fast trashers.
3. Super powerful stuff that can get you thin really quickly by trashing 2+ cards early in the game, like Donate, Chapel, Sentry and Peaceful Cult.

### Thinning Types

I have assigned one or more of the following thinning types to each of the thinners to be able to distinguish between them and allow for a gauge what kingdoms are able to trash. They include multiple types of information - which types of cards can be thinned, whether some sort of remodelling is possible, and whether the thinner does exile.
For this, I've defined the following categories:

- **Any**: This CSO can in principle thin any other card (not necessarily itself). Examples are Chapel, Remodel, or Sanctuary.
- **Copper**: Restriction to Copper thinning, e.g. Moneylender or Bonfire.
- **Exile**: The thinning is not actual trashing, but rather exiling. Can be assigned in addition to 'Any'. I have also labelled Island and Miser as Exilers as it's basically the same interaction.
- **Non-Treasure**: Restriction to only thin non-Treasure cards, e.g. Hermit or JoaT.
- **Non-Victory**: Restriction to only thin non-Victory cards, e.g. Enhance.
- **Remodel**: This indicates Remodel variants (gaining a card in exchange for the thinning), e.g. Enlarge, Displace, but also Remake or Upgrade.
- **Remodel\***: This indicates heavily restricted remodel variants that only allow you to thin certain types of cards, such as Jack of All Trades, Mine, or Acolyte.
- **Treasure**: Restriction to thin Treasure cards only, e.g. Spice Merchant.
- **Victory**: Restriction to thin Victory cards only, e.g. Acolyte.
