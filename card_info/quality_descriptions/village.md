### Village Quality

Villages are a heated target of debate [citation needed], but here I've decided to try to include everything that might enable to play you more than one terminal a turn.
The three different categories had the following distinctions in mind:

1. Bad Villages that barely deserve this name due to their one-shot nature (e.g. Necropolis) or are usually finicky to set up, such as Sauna/Avanto, Scepter or Prince.
2. Solid Villages that usually say +2 Actions, and most Throne variants
3. Incredible Villages that can make it so you almost won't need to think about Actions for the rest of the game (e.g. Champion), and also strong villages like Ports or Recruiter.

### Village Types

I've tried to provide Village types that might give you an idea what kind of Village a kingdom offers, which might be useful for assessing the accompanying draw types (e.g. a Handsize-decreasing Village + Moat-like draw will struggle to properly increase handsize).\
Villages that only barely fit the description, or are somewhat conditional have their type marked with a \*.

- **Handsize-neutral**: Anything resembling the basic *Village* archetype of the Base game. This includes Lost-City-like villages, even though they increase your handsize. Maybe I need a better name, go figure.
- **Handsize-decreasing**: Anything providing extra Actions while decreasing your handsize like Necropolis, Festival, or Conclave.
- **Villagers**: Anything providing Villagers.
- **On-gain**: Anything that will only provide a village effect if you gain a card (sometimes the card itself), like Academy, Band of Nomads, or Trail.
- **Throne**: Throne Room variants.
- **For-buy**: This only includes March, Prepare and Delay I believe; I just wanted to indicate that the Village effect is more or less useless without +Buy for those.
- **Single**: Anything that will at max provide one extra action per turn, e.g. Necropolis or Barracks.
- **Special**: Stuff that provides the Village effect in other surprising ways, e.g. Trail's on-trash, or League of Shopkeepers (which sometimes doesn't provide the effect at all).
