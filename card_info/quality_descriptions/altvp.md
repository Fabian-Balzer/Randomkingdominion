Having alternative ways to score is fun! I've tried to capture each cards' or landscapes' ability to do so in this category.

### Alternative VP Quality

The three quality values had the following distinctions in mind:

1. Stuff that does somehow affect scoring but only mildly succeeds in that. Most Cursers are in here as well, and also stuff that might reduce the opponent's VP by trashing their Victory Cards (e.g. Swindler, Saboteur, Knights). Also, rather weak Alt-VP (e.g. Mill) that can supplement some points, but usually doesn't tip the scales.
2. Moderate things that might sometimes incentivize you to build a little bigger or enable alternate strategies, but sometimes also just are welcoming additional VP such as Gardens, Feodom, Labyrinth, Tomb, Fountain, or Monument.
3. Centralizing stuff that might burn you badly if you ignore it, e.g. Collection, Keep, Triumph.

### Alternative VP Types

Since most alt-vp cards are quite unique, I haven't tried to further categorize them, although it might make sense to filter out cursing attacks sometimes. Oh well.
