Having alternative ways to score is fun! I've tried to capture each cards' or landscapes' ability to do so in this category.

### Alternative VP Quality

The three quality values had the following distinctions in mind:

1. Stuff that does somehow affect scoring but only mildly succeeds in that. Most Cursers are in here as well, and also stuff that might reduce the opponent's VP by trashing their Victory Cards (e.g. Swindler, Saboteur, Knights). Also, rather weak Alt-VP (e.g. Mill) that can supplement some points, but usually doesn't tip the scales.
2. Moderate things that might sometimes incentivize you to build a little bigger or enable alternate strategies, but sometimes also just are welcoming additional VP such as Gardens, Feodom, Labyrinth, Tomb, Fountain, or Monument.
3. Centralizing stuff that might burn you badly if you ignore it, e.g. Collection, Keep, Triumph.

### Alternative VP Types

I've identified the following types of Alt-VP for the CSOs:

- **Scaling**: The VP scale with the amount of certain cards, e.g. Gardens, Vineyards, Fairgrounds, Orchard, or Feodum.
- **Plain**: You get what you've signed up for, e.g. Mill, Nobles, or Tunnel.
- **VP Chips**: These CSOs enable you to acquire those shiny VP chips. Go get 'em!
- **Trashing**: These CSOs can trash cards of your opponents; sometimes, they might hit Duchies or even Provinces. Not the most convincing, but hey, you should be aware of that.
- **Cursing**: These CSOs allow you to gain a lead in VP by Cursing your opponents. Also not super powerful to rely on, but oh well.
- **Special**: Anything I couldn't directly assign to one of those categories, like Wolf Den or Divine Wind.
