### Added 5 Combos

#### bonfire - jack_of_all_trades (Synergy)
Bonfire can trash your Coppers rather quickly while Jack of all Trades can take care of the Estates while adding Silver payload, making for a fast moneyish strategy. You might want to supplement it with other kingdom cards though.
#### bridge - royal_carriage (Combo)
Getting 6 Royal Carriages on the mat an pairing that with a single Bridge will enable you to pile Provinces in about 12 turns if uncontested.
#### dungeon - tunnel (Combo)
Opening double Dungeon, followed by alternating Tunnel and Dungeon buys early can can gain you lots of Golds. As soon as you hit $8, start Provincing and you should be able to hit 6 Provinces and around 40 VP between t12 and t14.
#### feodum - groom (Rush)
Rushing for Grooms early on you will be able to then gobble up both Feoda and Silvers later on, quickly depleting piles.
#### stampede - storeroom (Combo)
Opening Storeroom and Silver, then getting a few Stampedes, pairing this with a Silver and Gold buy when possible can achieve 4 Provinces by turn 9, and 6 Provinces by ~t13, although the deck becomes inconsistent at that point. A second Storeroom can help with consistency, but it's not clear whether it's worth it.

### Changed 2 Combos

#### groom - island (Rush)
Just as with Gardens, going for Grooms and then Islands is a strong rush strategy. You even get Horses on Island gains, what more do you want?
