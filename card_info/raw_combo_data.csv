Alchemist/Change;You can Change Coppers/Estates into Alchemist for just 3/1 Debt.;Synergy;;
Alchemist/Journey;If you play Alchemists and buy Journey, as long as you have a Potion in play, you may topdeck the Alchemists for the Journey turn. You may again do so on the Journey turn.;Weak Synergy;;
Alchemist/Reckless;[Only if Alchemist is Reckless] - You may topdeck it during Clean-up if you have a Potion in play, circumventing Reckless' return-to-pile prompt.;Synergy;;
Alchemist/Woodworkers Guild;With Woodworkers' Guild, you can trash an Action card into an Alchemist without having to gain a Potion.;Weak Synergy;;
Alley/Enchantress;When under the Enchantress attack, playing Alley from your deck is essentially a Laboratory;Counter;;
Alliance/Merchant Guild;After buying a bunch of Merchant Guilds and hitting $10, trying to Alliance a bunch of times (while generating Coffers) can be a viable rush, especially if there is no Alt-VP available and the kingdom is on the weaker side.;Rush;;
Alms/Bridge Troll;The cost reduction from Bridge Trolls will allow Alms to gain more expensive cards, and might encourage not having Treasures in play.;Synergy;;
Alms/Canal;The cost reduction from Canal will allow Alms to gain more expensive cards, and might encourage not having Treasures in play.;Synergy;;
Alms/Cavalry;Almsing for Cavalry will allow you to play your Treasures after having returned to your Action phase, making for a great opening, especially with abundant Villages.;Combo;;
Alms/Cemetery;Almsing Cemetery early on can very quickly get you thin.;Synergy;;
Alms/Haunted Woods;Almsing is a way to get around the Haunted Woods attack, which is especially relevant if there is cost reduction around.;Counter;;

Alms/Villa;Almsing for Villas will allow you to play your Treasures later, allowing for an opening with $1 more, and staying relevant throughout the game.;Combo;;
Amass/Rebuild;Usually, the problem with Rebuild can be getting enough of them into your deck quickly - Amass lets you open double Rebuild, and allows you to easily pick up more if you miss them. Don't forget to buy some extra Duchies and Estates a bit later on as well! Be careful at evaluating this though, as some fast engine strategies (that also benefit from the early Amass boost) might still pose a challenge.;Combo;;
Animal Fair/Necropolis;Necropolis is a great Animal Fair target in the opening.;Weak Synergy;;
Apprentice/Market Square;Apprenticing Golds while discarding Market Squares is a nice Engine in itself, providing draw, Buys, and payload.;Combo;;
Arena/Enlightenment;As soon as Enlightenment is active, you'll be able to discard Coppers to Arena for some VP.;Weak Synergy;;
Arena/Faithful Hound;Discarding Faithful Hound to Arena will put it in hand for your next turn, where you'll be able to discard it again.;Weak Synergy;;

Arena/Village Green;Neat little synergy to play Village Greens for next turn for free while also picking up VP.;Synergy;;
Arena/Weaver;Arena offers you to play a Weaver for free during each of your turns, initially even getting you VP for it. You can still use this even if no VP are left on Arena, just keep in mind that there might be an autoplay in the online clients preventing you.;Weak Synergy;;
Artificer/Cursed Village;Artificer and Cursed Village's draw-to-6 go together quite well.;Weak Synergy;;
Artificer/Ferry;Artificer might benefit from Ferry's cost reduction, including on Artificer itself.;Weak Synergy;;

Artist/Mirror;With Mirror, you can gain additional Artists for $3 each.;Weak Synergy;;
Astrolabe/Guildhall;Stock up on Astrolabes, buy Guildhall ASAP and then spam Astrolabes and Coppers with all the remaining buys.

Barbarian/Fortress;Having a Fortress trashed from the top of your deck will put it into your hand and gain you a cheaper Action card.;Counter;;
Barbarian/Overlord;With Barbarian, you can trash your opponent's Overlords into Curses, while also playing Overlords as Barbarians is possible, making for a weird game of luck (I'm not even sure what to classify this as).;Synergy;;
Barbarian/Scrying Pool;With Scrying Pool, you might be able to set up targets for Barbarian. On the other hand, getting your own Scrying Pool trashed is awful as you will gain a Curse for it.;Weak Synergy;https://youtu.be/PF7Jx5RZIPk;Fabi: Daily playthrough
Barbarian/Trail;Having a Trail trashed from the top of your deck will allow you to draw a card, and gain a cheaper Action card.;Counter;;

Beggar/Enlightenment;As soon as Enlightenment is active, Beggar basically becomes a Smithy with optional Payload.;Combo;;
Beggar/Footpad;If you have an easy way of trashing the Coppers, Beggar can work as draw, and on rare weak kingdoms, rushing Beggars can make for a weird strategy.;Weak Synergy;;
Beggar/Guildhall;Hammering in Beggars and buying Guildhall ASAP is a strong 2-CSO combo, reaching ~6 Provinces by turn 12.;Rush;https://youtu.be/FChgLjGn-iI?si=imiMz1SKjwgBdKq8&t=134;tracer: Showcase video
Beggar/Panic;Once Panic is active, the Coppers gained from Beggar are returned after playing them, so essentially Beggar becomes a terminal Gold with 6 Buys attached to it.;Weak Synergy;;

Biding Time/Haunted Woods;Haunted Woods can shut down strategies relying on Biding Time pretty well.;Counter;;

Biding Time/Magnate;Biding Time being active lets you easily kick off with Magnate, and drawing dead Village isn't as bad as you will get to play them on the next turn.;Synergy;;

Biding Time/Outpost;Biding Time can both set up Outpost turns or, if they are duds, you can at least stash away three cards for the next one. Sometimes, gaining a second Outpost to ensure always playing one is worth it.;Synergy;https://youtu.be/A4J_Uz1Sjtg;Fabi: Showcase video
Biding Time/Rebuild;If you don't have any way to discard green cards, they will accumulate in your hand, and you won't be able to Rebuild them once Biding Time is active.;Nombo;;

Biding Time/Tactician;Since you discard your whole hand with Tactician, you won't be able to benefit from Biding Time on that turn, making Tactician decks less viable.;Nombo;;
Biding Time/Tea House;Having three Tea Houses and a Silver quickly becomes a golden Deck that can Province each turn, even immune to most discard attacks. Can sometimes be a bit clunky to set up.;Combo;https://youtu.be/A4J_Uz1Sjtg;Fabi: Showcase video
Black Cat/Guardian;Due to the timing of Guardian, you will not be protected from your opponent Cursing you with Black Cats during your turn.;Nombo;;
Black Cat/Harsh Winter;With Harsh Winter active, getting off multiple Black Cat plays during your opponent's turn will give them Debt on top of the Curses, disincentivizing greening even more.;Counter;;
Black Cat/Lighthouse;With a Lighthouse played this turn (!), you can avoid being Cursed by your opponent's Black Cats when greening. They'll still draw the cards for free though.;Counter;;
Black Cat/Moat;With a Moat in hand, you can avoid being Cursed by your opponent's Black Cats when greening. They'll still draw the cards for free though.;Counter;;

Black Market/Gatekeeper;Playing Gatekeeper before your opponent plays Black Market will lock them out of gaining most cards from Black Market.;Counter;;
Black Market/Haunted Woods;Haunted Woods can shut down Black Market, as you are forced to topdeck your hand when buying cards from the Black Market when under the Haunted Woods attack.;Counter;;
Black Market/Keep;Keep heavily incentivizes going for Treasures from the Black Market deck, as each will give you uncontested 5 VP.;Combo;;
Black Market/Museum;Each unique card from the Black Market will be worth an additional 2 VP with Museum around.;Synergy;;
Black Market/Tactician;Playing Black Market before Tactician allows you to get your Treasures into play before discarding your hand. Just remember to keep a card in hand to discard for Tactician.;Synergy;;
Bridge/Capitalism;With Capitalism active, you can play Bridges nonterminally, which quickly scales up.;Weak Synergy;;
Bridge/Flagship;Monolithically just getting 6 Flagships and a Bridge in play will enable you to pile Provinces in ~12 turns if uncontested.;Combo;;
Bridge/Practice;With lots of draw, it might be worth gunning for just having 4 Bridges and $6 in hand. Just make sure you have extra Buys and you'll easily be able to pile Provinces.;Combo;https://youtu.be/9bxlW5IFlEM;Fabi: Daily playthrough with find-the-win
Bridge/Way of the Turtle;Playing Bridges as Way of the Turtle can lead to a megaturn, but might take a while to set up, so usually some support is needed.;Weak Synergy;;
Broker/League of Shopkeepers;Racking up 10 Favors can make Brokers pretty strong, providing Actions, Buys, and flexibility when trashing stuff.;Weak Synergy;https://youtu.be/Nfj0YxBQ8Tg;Fabi: Daily playthrough
Bureaucracy/Groom; ;Nombo;https://youtu.be/frMkMuxn_go;Fabi: Daily playthrough
Bureaucracy/Horse;Horse gainers such as {Horse} are much worse with Bureaucracy active, as each Horse gain comes with a Copper (bar cost reduction active).;Nombo;;
Bureaucracy/Peddler;Even with Bureaucracy active, you don't gain Coppers off of buying Peddlers that have been reduced to 0.;Weak Synergy;;
Bureaucracy/Quarry;With Quarries reducing the cost of Action cards to 0, you can circumvent having to gain Coppers when buying them once Bureaucracy is active.;Weak Synergy;;
Cabin Boy/Shaman;Playing Cabin Boys becomes very attractive with Shaman around, as you can trash it at the start of your turn to gain another Cabin Boy or stronger Duration, and immediately regain it from the trash (also circumventing having to gain a junk card). Having at least a pair of them is recommended.;Combo;https://youtu.be/CIU-wdDhHEM;Fabi: Daily playthrough
Cage/Deliver;Don't miss out on the Deliver/Cage  opening, especially powerful on the 4/3 or 5/2 as you'll get to set aside a bunch on t2 already.;Weak Synergy;;

Capital/Herbalist;Even if you topdeck a Capital via Herbalist, you still have to take the debt.;Nombo;;

Capitalism/Enlightenment;As soon as Enlightenment is active, Capitalism can turn your juicy $-bearing Actions into Cantrips during the Action phase.;Nombo;;
Capitalism/Landing Party;Great way to topdeck the Landing Parties each turn if there is a +$-giving cantrip.;Synergy;;
Capitalism/Panic;As soon as Panic is active, Capitalism will cause you to return your $-bearing Actions to the Supply when discarding them from play.;Nombo;;
Capitalism/Patron;With Capitalism bought, playing Patrons as Treasures will turn them into Villages.;Weak Synergy;;
Capitalism/Souk;With Capitalism active, you can play the Souks as the last Treasures, increasing their value.;Weak Synergy;;
Carpenter/Footpad;With Footpad around, Carpenter becomes pretty strong, and with an empty deck and discard pile, Carpenter can even autopile as long as on other piles are empty.;Synergy;;
Castles/Keep;With Keep around, Humble Castle will be worth 5 extra VP, sometimes even making it worth opening.;Weak Synergy;;
Castles/Museum;Castles are worth an extra 2 VP with Museum around.;Weak Synergy;;
Cavalry/Collection;Getting Collections in play before returning to your Action phase and gaining more cards (such as Horses from Cavalry plays) is a good way to rack up VP quickly.;Synergy;;
Cavalry/Landing Party;You get to play Treasures to topdeck the Landing Parties, and can then Buy Cavalry to return to your Action phase and even draw two of them immediately.;Weak Synergy;;
Cavalry/Quarry;Having two Quarries in play lets you autopile Cavalries while drawing a bunch of cards.;Synergy;;
Cavalry/Quartermaster;Gaining Cavalries with Quartermaster will start off your turn with +2 Cards, +1 Buy.;Synergy;;
Cavalry/Receive Tribute;Very convenient to gain/buy a few things and return to your Action phase (gaining Horses helps, but also if you manage to gain three cards without having to play Cavalry);Synergy;;
Cavalry/Stockpile;Once you've drawn your deck, buying a Stockpile while discarding the others from Exile and then Cavalries can often lead to loopy situations, as you get to reuse the same Stockpiles multiple times.;Combo;https://youtu.be/_0-fIGT2daU;JNails: Daily playthrough

Change/Familiar;You can Change Coppers/Estates into Familiars for just 3/1 Debt.;Synergy;;

Chariot Race/Forum;With Forum, you can sometimes neatly set up the targets for Chariot Race.;Weak Synergy;;
Charlatan/Enlightenment;Once Enlightenment is active, you get to cantrip Curses and they become an Action-Treasure-Curse card, which also might have its merits.;Counter;;
Charlatan/Panic;Once Panic is active, you get to return Curses to their pile by playing them.;Counter;;
Charlatan/Pirate;In games where it's likely that players are going for Cursing, Pirate is more likely to be activated regularly.;Weak Synergy;;
Charm/Prince;On some boards, it might be a viable strategy to build for $8 and a bunch of Charms, then buy a Prince while gaining Provinces alongside.;Combo;;

Continue/Treasure Map;Good way to get loads of Golds into your deck quickly.;Weak Synergy;;

Cultist/Way of the Horse;With Way of the Horse, playing Cultist will provide your opponent with free Horses. Not advised.;Counter;;

Daimyo/Enlightenment;As soon as Enlightenment is active, playing a Daimyo before ending your Action phase will let you double-play Treasures for their Treasure effect.;Synergy;https://youtu.be/eJEdtWTF01g;Fabi: Daily playthrough
Daimyo/Joust;Being able to combine Renown with a couple of Daimyos is usually game-winning;Combo;https://youtu.be/eJEdtWTF01g?si=Yg0H_9P1F0xeeKbI&t=1240;Fabi: Daily playthrough

Death Cart/Way of the Horse;With Way of the Horse, by gaining Death Cart you essentially add three flexible Horses to your deck.;Synergy;;
Death Cart/Way of the Pig;With Way of the Pig, gaining the Ruins from Death Cart is not as detrimental as you can always pig them.;Weak Synergy;;
Death Cart/Woodworkers Guild;With Woodworkers' Guild around, gaining Death Cart is not as detrimental as you may trash the Ruins into something useful. Still usually wouldn't advise opening it.;Weak Synergy;;
Deliver/Improve;Buying Deliver before Improving will let you put the gained cards in your hand.;Weak Synergy;;
Deliver/Page;Don't miss out on the Deliver/Page opening, especially powerful on the 4/3 or 5/2 as you'll get to Deliver another one on t2 as well.;Weak Synergy;;
Deliver/Panic;"You really want to be the one triggering the Prophecy. Especially look out for it with Mountain Shrine, which you can in principle Deliver t1; but also with the other Omens, once it kicks in, you're in for a Copper flood ride. Watch out for Handsize attacks though!";Combo;;

Deliver/Siren;You can Deliver Sirens for $5 without the need to trash an Action for the Siren gain - quite strong (bit swingy in the opening);Synergy;;
Delve/Feodum;On weak boards, spamming Delve a lot, followed up by grabbing 6 or more VP-Feoda might be the way to go. Wouldn't recommend against medium-strong engines though as you will lack a lot of agency, especially if they can somehow contest the Feoda. But you can reach a staggering amount of points by t17 or so.;Weak Synergy;;
Delve/Guildhall;Spam Delve until you can't, buy Guildhall ASAP, and spam more Delves, flooding the deck with Silver. Once Guildhall is acquired, finish off the Delve chain with a Copper buy. Having $1 can be spent on a Delve buy without losing Coffers. Start Provincing with a stash of Coppers, you should hit 6 Provinces by t13.;Rush;https://youtu.be/FChgLjGn-iI?si=ReHamwVEARbnruBr&t=237;tracer: Showcase video
Den of Sin/Haunted Woods;Night cards are heavily disincentivized with Haunted Woods around, as you will have to topdeck your hand whenever buying cards, which happens before you would be able to play any Night cards.

Distant Lands/Innovation;Innovation makes Distant Land gains stronger - essentially 4 VP chips for $5 and passing up on your Innovation otherwise.;Weak Synergy;;

Donate/Market Square;Great to get lots of payload and buys into deck quickly.;Combo;;
