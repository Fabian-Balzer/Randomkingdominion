CSO1/CSO2;Description;Type;YTLink;YTComment

Advance/Enlightenment;As soon as Enlightenment is active, Coppers become great targets for Advance.;Weak Synergy;;
Alchemist/Change;You can Change Coppers/Estates into Alchemist for just 3/1 Debt.;Synergy;;
Alley/Enchantress;When under the Enchantress attack, playing Alley from your deck is essentially a Laboratory;Counter;;
Alliance/Merchant Guild;After buying a bunch of Merchant Guilds and hitting $10, trying to Alliance a bunch of times (while generating Coffers) can be a viable rush, especially if there is no Alt-VP available and the kingdom is on the weaker side.;Rush;;
Alms/Bridge Troll;The cost reduction from Bridge Trolls will allow Alms to gain more expensive cards, and might encourage not having Treasures in play.;Synergy;;
Alms/Cavalry;Almsing for Cavalry will allow you to play your Treasures after having returned to your Action phase, making for a great opening, especially with abundant Villages.;Combo;;
Alms/Cemetery;Almsing Cemetery early on can very quickly get you thin.;Synergy;;
Alms/Haunted Woods;Almsing is a way to get around the Haunted Woods attack, which is especially relevant if there is cost reduction around.;Counter;;
Alms/Hostelry;Almsing for Hostelries will get you rolling really quickly, as you can easily add 4 Horses and a Hostelry with a $4 hand.;Synergy;;
Alms/Mirror;With virtual coin available, buying Mirror before Almsing can let you gain additional Actions for $3 each without requiring the buys.;Weak Synergy;;
Alms/Mission;Almsing is pretty nice on Mission turns where you wouldn't be able to buy anything anyways.;Synergy;;
Alms/Odysseys;Almsing is pretty nice on otherwise unproductive Voyage turns.;Synergy;;

Alms/Villa;Almsing for Villas will allow you to play your Treasures later, allowing for an opening with $1 more, and staying relevant throughout the game.;Combo;;
Amass/Rebuild;Usually, the problem with Rebuild can be getting enough of them into your deck quickly - Amass lets you open double Rebuild, and allows you to easily pick up more if you miss them. Don't forget to buy some extra Duchies and Estates a bit later on as well! Be careful at evaluating this though, as some fast engine strategies (that also benefit from the early Amass boost) might still pose a challenge.;Combo;;
Apprentice/Market Square;Apprenticing Golds while discarding Market Squares is a nice Engine in itself, providing draw, Buys, and payload.;Combo;;
Arena/Enlightenment;As soon as Enlightenment is active, you'll be able to discard Coppers to Arena for some VP.;Weak Synergy;;
Arena/Village Green;Neat little synergy to play Village Greens for next turn for free while also picking up VP.;Synergy;;

Artisan/Sheepdog;Gaining Sheepdogs to hand allows you to immediately play them for draw.;Synergy;;
Artist/Mirror;With Mirror, you can gain additional Artists for $3 each.;Weak Synergy;;
Astrolabe/Guildhall;Stock up on Astrolabes, buy Guildhall ASAP and then spam Astrolabes and Coppers with all the remaining buys.

Barbarian/Overlord;With Barbarian, you can trash your opponent's Overlords into Curses, while also playing Overlords as Barbarians is possible, making for a weird game of luck (I'm not even sure what to classify this as).;Synergy;;
Barbarian/Scrying Pool;With Scrying Pool, you might be able to set up targets for Barbarian. On the other hand, getting your own Scrying Pool trashed is awful as you will gain a Curse for it.;Weak Synergy;https://youtu.be/PF7Jx5RZIPk;Fabi: Daily playthrough
Basilica/Lucky Coin;As long as you have $2, playing Lucky Coin will give you +2 VP from Basilica.;Synergy;;
Basilica/Stampede;Hitting $7 and buying Stampede will let you gobble up Basilica points.;Weak Synergy;;
Basilica/Supplies;As long as you have $2, playing Supplies will give you +2 VP from Basilica.;Synergy;;
Baths/Salt the Earth;Get +3 VP each turn you hit $4 while bring the game to an end quickly using Salt the Earth on Province. Fails if opponent can get to ~20 VP in ~10 turns while contesting some Baths points.;Combo;;
Beggar/Enlightenment;As soon as Enlightenment is active, Beggar basically becomes a Smithy with optional Payload.;Combo;;
Beggar/Footpad;If you have an easy way of trashing the Coppers, Beggar can work as draw, and on rare weak kingdoms, rushing Beggars can make for a weird strategy.;Weak Synergy;;
Beggar/Guildhall;Hammering in Beggars and buying Guildhall ASAP is a strong 2-CSO combo, reaching ~6 Provinces by turn 12.;Rush;https://youtu.be/FChgLjGn-iI?si=imiMz1SKjwgBdKq8&t=134;tracer: Showcase video
Beggar/Panic;Once Panic is active, the Coppers gained from Beggar are returned after playing them, so essentially Beggar becomes a terminal Gold with 6 Buys attached to it.;Weak Synergy;;
Biding Time/City Quarter;Biding Time being active lets you easily kick off with City Quarters.;Weak Synergy;;
Biding Time/Crossroads;Insane start-of-turn draw if you have stashed away a few Victory cards.;Combo;;

Biding Time/Frigate;Frigate can shut down Biding Time pretty well.;Counter;;
Biding Time/Haunted Woods;Haunted Woods can shut down strategies relying on Biding Time pretty well.;Counter;;
Biding Time/Magnate;Biding Time being active lets you easily kick off with Magnate, and drawing dead Village isn't as bad as you will get to play them on the next turn.;Synergy;;
Biding Time/Mission;Mission is super nice once Biding Time is active, as it allows you to stash away the cards you don't use on your extra turn, essentially trading $4 and a buy for at least 5 extra cards in your next-turn hand.;Synergy;;
Biding Time/Odysseys;Voyage is super nice once Biding Time is active, as it allows you to stash away the cards you don't use.;Synergy;;
Biding Time/Outpost;Biding Time can both set up Outpost turns or, if they are duds, you can at least stash away three cards for the next one. Sometimes, gaining a second Outpost to ensure always playing one is worth it.;Weak Synergy;;
Biding Time/Rebuild;If you don't have any way to discard green cards, they will accumulate in your hand and you won't be able to Rebuild them once Biding Time is active.;Nombo;;
Biding Time/Sheepdog;Reacting Sheepdogs in your Buy phase once Biding Time is active will draw you cards that you can set aside for your next turn.;Synergy;;
Biding Time/Shepherd;Very nice to set up lots of Shepherd draw. Might very well be worth not trashing any Estates, especially if Biding Time is likely to activate quickly.;Combo;;
Biding Time/Tactician;Since you discard your whole hand with Tactician, you won't be able to benefit from Biding Time on that turn, making Tactician decks less viable.;Nombo;;
Biding Time/Tea House;Having three Tea Houses and a Silver quickly becomes a golden Deck that can Province each turn, even immune to most discard attacks. Can sometimes be a bit clunky to set up.;Combo;;
Biding Time/Trail;Reacting Trails in your Buy phase once Biding Time is active will draw you cards that you can set aside for your next turn.;Weak Synergy;;
Black Cat/Guardian;Due to the timing of Guardian, you will not be protected from your opponent Cursing you with Black Cats during your turn.;Nombo;;
Black Cat/Lighthouse;With a Lighthouse played this turn (!), you can avoid being Cursed by your opponent's Black Cats when greening. They'll still draw the cards for free though.;Counter;;
Black Cat/Moat;With a Moat in hand, you can avoid being Cursed by your opponent's Black Cats when greening. They'll still draw the cards for free though.;Counter;;
Black Cat/Rebuild;The presence of Black Cats should disincentivize going for a Rebuild strategy, as you would inevitably gain green cards.;Counter;;

Black Market/Capitalism;With Capitalism active, you can chain Black Markets.;Weak Synergy;;
Black Market/Gatekeeper;Playing Gatekeeper before your opponent plays Black Market will lock them out of gaining most cards from Black Market.;Counter;;
Black Market/Keep;Keep heavily incentivizes going for Treasures from the Black Market deck, as each will give you uncontested 5 VP.;Combo;;
Black Market/Tactician;Playing Black Market before Tactician allows you to get your Treasures into play before discarding your hand.;Synergy;;
Bridge/Capitalism;With Capitalism active, you can play Bridges nonterminally, which quickly scales up.;Synergy;;
Bridge/Flagship;Monolithically just getting 6 Flagships and a Bridge in play will enable you to pile Provinces in ~12 turns if uncontested.;Combo;;
Bridge/Practice;With lots of draw, it might be worth gunning for just having 4 Bridges and $6 in hand. Just make sure you extra Buys and you can easily pile Provinces;Combo;https://youtu.be/9bxlW5IFlEM;Fabi: Daily playthrough with find-the-win
Bridge/Way of the Turtle;Playing Bridges as Way of the Turtle can lead to a megaturn, but might take a while to set up, so usually some support is needed.;Weak Synergy;;
Broker/League of Shopkeepers;Racking up 10 Favors can make Brokers pretty strong, providing Actions, Buys, and flexibility when trashing stuff.;Weak Synergy;https://youtu.be/Nfj0YxBQ8Tg;Fabi: Daily playthrough
Bureaucracy/Groom; ;Nombo;https://youtu.be/frMkMuxn_go;Fabi: Daily playthrough
Bureaucracy/Horse;Horse gainers such as {Horse} are much worse with Bureaucracy active, as each Horse gain comes with a Copper (bar cost reduction active).;Nombo;;
Bureaucracy/Peddler;You don't gain Coppers off of buying Peddlers that have been reduced to 0.;Weak Synergy;;
Bureaucracy/Quarry;With Quarries reducing the cost of Action cards to 0, you can circumvent having to gain Coppers when buying them.;Weak Synergy;;
Cabin Boy/Shaman;Playing Cabin Boys becomes very attractive with Shaman around, as you can trash it at the start of your turn to gain another Cabin Boy or stronger Duration, and immediately regain it from the trash (also circumventing having to gain a junk card). Having at least a pair of them is recommended.;Combo;https://youtu.be/CIU-wdDhHEM;Fabi: Daily playthrough
Capital/Crypt;As long as you stash away your Capitals in Crypts, you never have to take the 6D.;Combo;;
Capital/Herbalist;Even if you topdeck a Capital via Herbalist, you still have to take the debt.;Nombo;;
Capital/Highwayman;Even if the on-play effect of Capital is nullified by an opponent's Highwayman attack, you will still need to take 6D upon discarding it from play.;Nombo;;

Castles/Keep;With Keep around, Humble Castle will be worth 5 extra VP, sometimes even making it worth opening.;Weak Synergy;;
Cavalry/Collection;Getting Collections in play before returning to your Action phase and gaining more cards (such as Horses from Cavalry plays) is a good way to rack up VP quickly.;Synergy;;
Cavalry/Landing Party;You get to play Treasures to topdeck the Landing Parties, and can then Buy Cavalry to return to your Action phase and even draw two of them immediately.;Weak Synergy;;
Cavalry/Quarry;Having two Quarries in play lets you autopile Cavalries while drawing a bunch of cards.;Synergy;;
Cavalry/Receive Tribute;Very convenient to gain/buy a few things and return to your Action phase (gaining Horses helps, but also if you manage to gain three cards without having to play Cavalry);Synergy;;
Cavalry/Stockpile;Once you've drawn your deck, buying a Stockpile while discarding the others from Exile and then Cavalries can often lead to loopy situations, as you get to reuse the same Stockpiles multiple times.;Combo;https://youtu.be/_0-fIGT2daU;JNails: Daily playthrough

Chariot Race/Forum;With Forum, you can sometimes neatly set up the targets for Chariot Race.;Weak Synergy;;
Charlatan/Enlightenment;Once Enlightenment is active, you get to cantrip Curses and they become an Action-Treasure-Curse card, which also might have its merits.;Counter;;
Charlatan/Panic;Once Panic is active, you get to return Curses to their pile by playing them.;Counter;;
Charlatan/Pirate;In games where it's likely that players are going for Cursing, Pirate is more likely to be activated regularly.;Weak Synergy;;

Collection/Enlightenment;As soon as Enlightenment is active, it becomes even more attractive to get more Collections, as all Treasures will also be Actions.;Synergy;;

Collection/Supplies;Playing Collections before Supplies will give you VP tokens for each Horse gain.;Synergy;;
Colonnade/Enlightenment;As soon as Enlightenment is active, buying Coppers can yield Colonnade points.;Weak Synergy;;

Daimyo/Peasant;Playing Daimyo/Disciple/Daimyo with an otherwise empty deck will autopile Daimyos and let you gain a bunch of other stuff.;Combo;;

Deliver/Siren;You can Deliver Sirens for $5 without the need to trash an Action for the Siren gain - quite strong (bit swingy in the opening);Synergy;;
Delve/Feodum;On weak boards, spamming Delve a lot, followed up by grabbing 6 or more VP-Feoda might be the way to go. Wouldn't recommend against medium-strong engines though as you will lack a lot of agency, especially if they can somehow contest the Feoda. But you can reach a staggering amount of points by t17 or so.;Weak Synergy;;
Delve/Guildhall;Spam Delve until you can't, buy Guildhall ASAP, and spam more Delves, flooding the deck with Silver. Once Guildhall is acquired, finish off the Delve chain with a Copper buy. Having $1 can be spent on a Delve buy without losing Coffers.

Forum/Village Green;Forum discards, VG activates on discard, effectively turning Forum into a drawing Village.;Synergy;;
