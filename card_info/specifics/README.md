# Quality assignments

This document briefly explains my thoughts behind the different qualities and assignments.

## Attacks

### Attack Quality

Basically, any attack will be assigned a quality based on its (clearly subjective) suppressiveness.
Some cards that do not have the 'Attack' type (like Masquerade, Embargo or Possession) will also be labeled as attacks.

### Attack Types

In addition to its strength, each of these attacks will be labelled with its AttackType, where I define the following ones:

- **Deck order**: Attacks that dabble with the order of the opponent's deck (such as Rabble, but also Jester or Swindler)
- **Doom**: Since the hexes can be such a mixed bag, I assigned each Doom - Attack only the Doom type (which include basically all of the other types)
- **Handsize**: Militia, Raider and the likes.
- **Indirect**: These are mainly the ones that do not explicitly state the AttackType, but also stuff influencing your decisions like Blockade. Also: Monkey and Shaman as unconventional 'Attacks'
- **Junking**: Looters, Cursers, Copper feeders
- **Scoring**: Everything that might Curse.
- **Trashing**: Stuff that might trash cards from the opponent's deck. Cardinal is also in here, I guess.
- **Turn worsening**: Stuff that will make the opponent's turn worse and didn't really fit any of the other categories (mainly stuff giving out -Card and -Coin tokens)

## Village

### Village Quality

Villages are a heated target of debate [citation needed], but here I've decided to try to include everything that might enable to play you more than one terminal a turn.
The three different categories had the following distinctions in mind:

1. Bad Villages that barely deserve this name due to their one-shot nature (e.g. Necropolis) or are usually finnicky to set up, such as Sauna/Avanto, Scepter or Prince.
2. Solid Villages that usually say +2 Actions, and most Throne variants
3. Incredible Villages that can make it so you almost won't need to think about Actions for the rest of the game (e.g. Champion, Academy), and also strong villages like Ports or Recruiter.

## Draw

### Draw Quality

Almost everything that can increase your handsize. I think I've excluded virtual draw like Cargo Ship, and also Trickster.
Cantrips of course don't draw.
The three categories had the following distinctions in mind:

1. Stuff that draws you once in a while or is just kinda weak, e.g. Settlers/BV, Ride, Summon and the likes. Capital City and Way of the Cameleon can also draw given things that generate $.
2. Lab- and Moat-like things.
3. All things providing +3 Cards or other unusual forms of very effective draw (e.g. City Quarter).

## Thinning

### Thinning Quality

I am deliberately including exiling here, and also remodelers that just improve the quality of the cards in your deck (e.g. Enhance or even Mine).
The three categories had the following distinctions in mind:

1. Weakish thinning stuff that tends to be somewhat niche such as Acolyte, Improve, Enlarge, or Governor.
2. All of the trashers and exilers that can thin one card at a time.
3. Powerful stuff that can get you thin by trashing 2+ cards like Donate, Chapel, Sentry, Peaceful Cult etc.

### Thinning Types


## Interactivity

### InteractivityQuality

I sometimes try to curate kingdoms that include interactive components apart from the dance around piles and timing when to green in relation to your opponent. Of course all attacks are inherently interactive, but Dominion offers a lot of other player interactions like Artefacts, Gathering-Type cards or split piles. The ranking here is quite random and subjective.
The three categories had the following distinctions in mind:

1. Stuff that can barely be called interactive but is still better than most solitaire cards - here I included obvious once like trash interactions (Graverobber, Lich), Artifacts that aren't that relevant (Swashy), far-stretched stuff like Band of Misfits (depends on the piles you empty if opponents), Landmarks with VP tokens (where timing relative to opponents matters), and most split piles (relying on opponent to uncover stuff?).
2. Basically all attacks and random stuff that felt fairly interactive such as Advisor or Temple or Border Guard.
3. Stuff that requires an opponent to make sense like Flagbearer, Family of Inventors, Young Witch (Bane stuff matters), Monkey, but also strong Attacks that might alter the way you play like Clashes, or Shaman.

## Alternate Paths to Victory

### AltVPQuality

Having alternative ways to score is fun! I've tried to capture each cards' or landscapes' ability to do so in this category.
The three categories had the following distinctions in mind:

1. Stuff that does somehow affect scoring but only mildly succeeds in that. Most Cursers are in here as well, and also stuff that might reduce the opponent's VP by trashing their Victory Cards (e.g. Swindler, Saboteur, Knights).
2. Moderate things that might sometimes incentivize you to build a little bigger or enable alternate strategies, but sometimes are just welcoming additional VP such as Gardens, Feodom, Labyrinth, Tomb, Fountain, or Monument.
3. Centralizing stuff that might burn you badly if you ignore it, e.g. Collection, Keep
