## Info:
    These files contain additional columns for each of the cards.
### AttackType:
    What harm does an attack inflict?
    Important: Cursers are not explicitly labelled junkers.
### DrawQuality
    The draw quality is a number x with 0 <= x <= 10, where x = 2*n for
    n being the number of cards the card draws.
    Cards with no draw have x = 0, cards with weird draw were judged by
    my subjective gut feeling,
    i. e. Scrying Pool has x = 10 while Courtyard has x = 5.
